# Opening the Work & Co Portland Office

## Background

I was living in San Francisco when the discussion about opening new offices began. There was talk of opening an office in San Francisco and potentially one in Portland.

The decision to open in Portland came when the principal design partner on the West Coast decided not to move to San Francisco. I was also starting a family at the time, and Portland was appealing for several reasons:

- I'm originally from Oregon
- It was far more affordable for raising children
- It offered a better quality of life

## The Early Days

We hired a couple of people who agreed to work for Work & Co without an office initially. At first, we met in coffee shops, then transitioned to working out of a house in the Overlook neighborhood that one of our hires had a connection with.

As the team grew—including a designer from the New York office who relocated to Portland and another new hire—the house filled up quickly. During this period, we actively searched for a proper office space.

## Finding the Office

We found an office downtown that could accommodate 25 people. This was before the Ritz Carlton was built, when the area was still near the Rings and food carts. It became a lovely place to work, and we eventually filled the office.

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Commercial Real Estate Moves Slowly

Commercial real estate transactions move much more slowly than residential real estate deals—an important consideration when planning office expansions.

### 2. Authentic Leadership

As a leader, it's crucial to maintain composure and stay positive, but you can't be fake. You have to be genuine and real while maintaining a positive outlook.

### 3. Understanding Generational Differences

Working with and hiring younger people taught me that different generations value different things at work:

- Some people value praise more than others
- Some prioritize promotions over salary increases
- Individual values around work vary significantly

Having empathy for these different perspectives was surprisingly important for effective leadership. Understanding what motivates each person individually rather than assuming everyone shares the same priorities became a key insight.
