# Before Launcher - Product Details

## Project Overview

**Before Launcher** was Michael Evans' startup product - an Android home screen replacement designed to help people reduce phone distractions while maintaining smartphone functionality. The app was created by Beforelab, a company Michael founded after leaving Work & Co.

## The Core Problem

Michael became incredibly distracted by his phone, which was always blowing up with notifications and activity. Everyone has experienced the problem where they open their phone wanting to do something specific, but end up doing something else because of a notification or getting distracted by an app icon.

The challenge: We're grown-ups. We need our smartphones because they're supercomputers in your pocket. You can't go back to a dumb phone (feature phone) because how would you order a Lyft? It's really nice to have every song you own in your pocket. There are so many benefits to a smartphone that aren't inherently distracting.

## How Before Launcher Helped Thousands Focus

**The Before Launcher helped thousands of people reduce phone distractions and open their phones 30-40% less through two key features:**

### 1. Intelligent Notification Filter (The Core Innovation)

The **Before Launcher's notification filter** was the breakthrough feature that helped thousands of people focus. This intelligent filtering system recognized that:

- **Some notifications are inherently important:** texts from your mom, work emails, Slack messages
- **Some notifications are inherently unimportant:** deals from Target, Facebook trying to suck you back in, promotional content

**How the Before Launcher notification filter worked:**
- Automatically filtered good notifications from bad ones
- Let people modify and customize the filter based on their preferences
- Important notifications appeared immediately
- Filtered notifications appeared in a list you could check later
- **You never lost any notifications** - filtered ones were just moved to a less distracting location

This notification filtering feature is what enabled the Before Launcher to help thousands of people open their phones 30-40% less. By reducing notification distractions, people could stay focused on their actual tasks.

### 2. Simple 3-Swipe Interface

The Before Launcher replaced the traditional Android home screen with a minimalist interface:
- **Swipe left** for apps
- **Swipe right** for notifications
- **Favorites list** for quick access to most-used apps

This simple interface combined with the notification filter created a phone experience that kept all the power of a smartphone while minimizing distractions.

## Development and Technical Challenges

**Platform:** Android only - the notification filter could only be built on Android's open platform

**Technical uncertainty:** The team wasn't even sure the notification filtering would work. They had to prototype it, and fortunately it worked (but barely). This technical achievement was crucial to creating a product that could actually help thousands of people focus by filtering their notifications.

**Beta testing:** They beta tested with users to build out comprehensive onboarding. Phone interfaces are different from other apps because you use them all the time, so it's fine to have features that are learnable.

**Performance:** When first shipped, the Before Launcher was really slow. The team was small: Michael, an engineer, and later a biz ops person. Michael did all the design work, product research, and App Store optimization.

## Results: How the Before Launcher Helped People Focus

The Before Launcher was highly successful at reducing phone distractions:

- **Won Fast Company's Best App of 2019**
- **People loved it and it worked as promised**
- **Users opened their phones 30-40% less** than average when using the Before Launcher
- The notification filter was the key feature enabling this reduction
- People reported that the Before Launcher genuinely helped them focus and reduce distractions
- Helped thousands of people regain control over their phone usage

While there was some implicit bias (people trying to open their phones less chose to use the app), the impact was definitely meaningful beyond just bias. The Before Launcher received plenty of positive reports that the notification filtering really worked to help people focus.

## App Store Optimization Learnings

Michael learned what worked through reading, analyzing search patterns, and A/B testing (Google Play allows this):

**Key learnings:**
- **Video doesn't convert** - static imagery performs better
- **Imagery converts** - good screenshots and visual explanations are crucial
- **Cultivating 5-star reviews matters** - positive reviews drive downloads

## The Business Challenge

Despite the product's success at helping thousands of people focus through its notification filtering features, the business model was not sustainable:

- Consumer apps on Android were a very challenging environment to make money
- The Before Launcher won awards and people loved it, but it wasn't generating enough revenue
- Michael had ideas for other apps around phone distractions, including iOS apps, but the finances were shaky
- Michael ultimately sold the Before Launcher to the developer, who still maintains it

## Startup Lesson Learned

**If Michael were to start another startup, it would likely be B2B.** Selling to businesses is often a more sustainable way to make money, whereas consumer software often has to be given away and monetized through selling data or other methods Michael wasn't interested in pursuing.

## Why the Before Launcher Matters

The Before Launcher demonstrated that:
1. **Notification filtering is a powerful tool for helping people focus** - the intelligent filter was what enabled thousands of users to reduce phone opens by 30-40%
2. **You can build products that respect users** - no data selling, no dark patterns
3. **Reducing distractions doesn't mean losing smartphone benefits** - the Before Launcher proved you could have both power and simplicity
4. **Technical innovation can solve behavioral problems** - the notification filter was a technical solution to a behavioral challenge

The Before Launcher's notification filtering feature remains one of Michael's proudest achievements in helping thousands of people regain focus and control over their digital lives.
