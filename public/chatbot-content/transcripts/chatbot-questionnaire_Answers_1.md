## Early Education

I grew up in Eugene, Oregon, where the University of Oregon is located. I attended Fox Hollow Elementary School, Roosevelt Middle School, and South Eugene High School. My elementary and middle school years were spent in French immersion programs, though I didn't continue with French immersion in high school. All were public schools, and the public school system in Eugene was excellent.

I was raised by hippies. My house is purple, my mom is a shaman, and there was a yurt in my backyard. One of my first AI building and design projects was actually creating her website at coronagaten.com.

## First Love of Technology

My dad gave me his old Mac Plus, which really dates me. That Mac Plus was my first computer, and I instantly fell in love with it. I got a 2400 baud modem and was able to connect to BBSs. I remember going on America Online for the first time and really feeling connected to the rest of the world in a way I hadn't before.

I also loved that you could actually build things and make your own games. I learned BASIC and Pascal, and would make HyperCard games. That period in middle school really got me interested in technology.

However, in high school I focused more on English. I loved reading, learning, narratives, history, and political science. I struggled a bit as a freshman but was fortunate to have smart friends who taught me how to study and get good grades. I learned that not everything has to be perfect when you're in school—sometimes just getting the grade is worth it.

I earned an International Baccalaureate degree from South Eugene High School.

## College

I attended the University of Colorado in Boulder and studied English and political science. During my time there, I spent a year abroad at the University of Sussex in England. One of my close friends there got his degree in artificial intelligence, which blew me away in 1999—I was amazed that you could major in this stuff. That's when I learned about neural networks and discovered that much of what was theorized about AI turned out to be true.

I didn't really get back into computers until towards the end of college, when I realized that writing poetry wasn't going to pay the bills.

## Early Career Jobs

I started working when I was 11. My work history includes:
- Working in a lumberyard (first job at age 11)
- Paper route
- Washing dishes in a restaurant
- Telemarketing (which was terrible)
- Delivering pizzas
- Working in a drugstore on campus during college

## Entry Into Tech

After graduating in 2001, right after the first dot-com bubble crashed, I moved back to Eugene and was trying to figure out what to do with my life. I eventually got a job doing data entry at Semantec, a software company where we cleaned addresses.

After a few days, I got promoted to a better temp position as a data analyst/business analyst. Someone put down an "Idiot's Guide to SQL" book and told me to learn it. I'd never heard of SQL before, but I started learning about databases and was fortunate to have some really good bosses.

I worked on an ERP/CRM Siebel project with consultants. I noticed these consultants made quite a bit more money than I did, and they didn't seem that much smarter than me. They liked me and started a company, which I joined to do Salesforce and NetSuite implementations as a solutions architect.

This was around 2003-2004, and it was one of the first remote companies I could think of. I was good at the work, though I didn't find building sales systems or accounting systems as interesting then as I might now.

## Move to New York

I moved from Oregon to New York, where a lot of my family lives, and continued working remotely. I worked with a career coach named Maggie Mistal, one of her first clients, to figure out what I should be doing.

I'd always loved user-focused design and Apple products—things that worked well and were simple. There were digital design agencies in New York like R/GA and Huge.

## Huge (2008)

In 2008, I left my job at Demand Solutions Group right when the 2008 crash happened. I was looking for work and found an interview at Huge off a Craigslist ad for a technical analyst/business analyst position. I didn't get the first job but interviewed well, and they called me back when a second position opened.

### Broadway.com

I worked on Broadway.com, my first at-scale project. The designs were beautiful, but I learned a lot from what was honestly a failed project. I was responsible for writing the specifications. The UX work didn't seem to hit the mark—it didn't really understand what the product was. The technical architecture also had significant flaws.

It was a Django/Python project, and I remember one of the junior Python developers expressing concerns about the technical architecture. Sure enough, when it shipped, it worked well for about three minutes before crashing and burning, melting all the servers. The technical architecture was so flawed it showed up in presentations about what not to do in Django.

That was a big teachable moment: listen to your engineers and make sure your plans are sound. I wound up leading that project because no one else was doing it, which suited me.

### HouseLogic.com (National Association of Realtors)

By this point, I'd gone from being an analyst to a project manager. We worked on a blue-sky project for the National Association of Realtors—a consumer-facing product for homeowners rather than realtors.

This Django project taught me about product evolution and product-market fit. Sometimes ideas you're really tied to and spend a lot of time on don't prove to be the best in the market. It's important not to be sentimental and not to fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy—if it doesn't work, move on and figure out what does.

The initial idea was a tool-based site for homeowners to track projects, but what really made sense was a content site providing information about home improvements and value.

### Other Projects

I worked on several other projects including:
- Pentamedia (a Drupal project, another content site)
- HBO Go (Canadian version for Astral)
- Early tap-to-pay payment products
- TV apps

### Target

Target was one of Huge's biggest clients, generating the most revenue that year. I traveled to Minneapolis every week, working on about 20 different projects.

What I learned at Target was the value of strategy—having a strategy that inspires people. The partnership worked so well because of Target's inspirational strategy of being the place that people love and selling products people love, versus Walmart's more transactional approach.

We did forward-thinking "future of retail" work, extending the aisles with phones and doing QR code work. I was skeptical about QR codes at the time, thinking nobody would use them—I was wrong. They became super useful once Apple integrated them into their phone app, and especially during the pandemic.

## Work & Co (Founding Employee)

The founders of Work & Co—Felipe Memoria, Gene Liebel, Marcelo, and Joe—had worked together at Huge and knew me from Target projects. When they were starting Work & Co, my friend Mohan texted me about needing someone in San Francisco eventually. A couple of weeks later, he called about a pitch they weren't expected to win.

They won it—Virgin America's website—and needed someone in San Francisco. I was one of the first employees at Work & Co.

### Virgin America

Virgin America was probably still the most technically challenging project I've worked on. It was the first responsive airline website, and when it launched, it won probably 20 different industry awards and was very successful in terms of conversion.

An airline ticket is one of the more complex consumer products that people buy a few times a year. There are so many decisions: when you leave, flight duration, connections, return flights, seat selection, forms to fill out, and compliance requirements. The backend ran on Saber's IBM mainframes—ancient tech.

This was the first big Angular project and one of the first big single-page apps, really proving that SPAs could scale. We were working with cutting-edge technology harnessed to some of the least cutting-edge technology.

The project taught me about the importance of talent. We kept bringing in people—developers and designers—and just kept hitting the jackpot with the talent we found.

### Work & Co Portland

After Virgin America shipped successfully, I had an opportunity to move to Portland to be closer to family. I had a kid at that point and opened the Work & Co Portland office with Joe Stewart.

Opening the office taught me that leadership, while it can seem complex, boils down to its simplest elements: treating others as you would like to be treated, caring about your colleagues, showing it, and being there.

In Portland, I worked on:
- Aesop.com (a wonderful e-commerce project)
- Fox's video applications
- Lyft
- Continued work with Virgin America and later Alaska Airlines after Alaska bought Virgin America

## Beforelab

I had an idea for a simpler phone launcher. Everyone had smartphones and was becoming really distracted by them. The concept was to minimize distracting features while keeping the power and smart features you actually need—a supercomputer in your pocket without the distractions.

I left Work & Co to start Beforelab and created the Before Launcher. I learned that even if you have a successful product, the business model needs viability too. Consumer apps, especially on Android, were a very challenging environment to make money in.

We launched the app and it won awards, including Fast Company's Best App of 2019. People liked it and it did what it promised—people opened their phones less when using our launcher. But it wasn't making enough money.

This was around the time of the pandemic. I sold the app and company to a developer we were working with.

## Pandemic & Primary Parent

During the pandemic, I became a primary parent for a significant period. I did a little consulting work on the side, but mostly was responsible for young children learning from home. This gave me tremendous empathy for moms and what they go through—it's very challenging to be responsible for young children, especially during a pandemic.

## Return to Work

After consulting with Huge/Elephant again, I went full-time with them and then was hired by Raw Materials (formerly Handsome). I learned that it takes more than energy and a good brand to be successful—you need consistency in your approach and real value that you continue to deliver for clients, or they'll stop working with you.

The company went from about 50 people when I started to 7 people when I left.

## AI & Machine Learning Journey

My interest in AI started back in 1999 at the University of Sussex when my friend studied artificial intelligence. That's when I learned about neural networks and much of the theory that proved to be true.

I've always been at the forefront of innovative technology spaces and enjoyed learning about new products. The Amazon Alexa was a disappointment—I expected to be able to talk to it like AI, but it had very rigid responses and never really improved.

When ChatGPT first launched, I was fascinated but was heads down working with Casa Bonita on their restaurant reservation software, queuing system, and membership club (which had hundreds of thousands of people join).

### The "Oh Shit" Moment

In March 2025, after being laid off from Raw Materials, I had my "oh shit" moment. I was with my son trying to build a Dungeons & Dragons app, and we built something useful in an hour with Replit. This would have taken a team a couple days or a week at least to build something like that.

I did research on AI, which you can see at mevans212.com. I called all my friends and asked them questions about AI and how it was impacting their work and software development.

I continued building with AI and realized I had a knack for it. My experience as a business analyst, project manager, and startup CEO where I did everything myself—including so much of the design—gave me soup-to-nuts knowledge that allowed me to effectively oversee AI as we work together on projects.

The tooling got better, and I got deeper into it. I met some Canadians who are also at the forefront, and we've been exchanging tips on how to build with AI.

## Things I'm Proud Of

- Shipping Virgin America, having it work, and seeing conversion go up
- Opening the Portland office
- Starting the product management team and being one of the founders of Work & Co
- Being a "little army of one"—while I don't know everything, I go pretty deep across research, strategy, design, UX design, technical architecture, and delivery, and can do many things myself

One of the things I love about working in this space is getting to work with super talented people who teach me so much. I've learned tremendously from everyone in my past and feel very lucky.

## Technologies & Technical Evolution

I've worked with web and mobile tech, front ends, and back ends, and have seen the evolution from:
- Cutting out special PNGs to support IE6
- Building drag-and-drop functionality from scratch
- Building charting for the United Nations Development Program from scratch
- Weeks-long tasks becoming days-long tasks
- Complex infrastructure decisions for scaling to relatively straightforward setups with modern tools like Vercel

### Technologies I've Worked With But Wouldn't Use Again

**Drupal** - I really did not like the experience of working with that software.

I try to be platform agnostic. Once you work with enough software platforms—from CMSs to e-commerce platforms and engines—you understand there's a lot of similarity between them. They either:
- Offer lots of flexibility, but you have to build everything yourself
- Are constrained but can get you to a solution quickly, though you have to do it their way

One of the most interesting things about AI is how this paradigm is different.
