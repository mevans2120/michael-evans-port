Question one, what are you doing now professionally? Um. I am consulting, and I'm also, uh, have an interest in a startup called PostPal.  Um, and we are basically building, uh, an app for people who have gone through procedure and are looking for basically better, better care, and it's sort of, then, um, the sheets of paper that you get after you have a procedure, like, say, a colonoscopy, or what have you. Um, I'm interested in any kind of interesting work that, uh, things that I like. Um, I like challenging opportunities, sort of challenging problems to solve.  Um, I love working with amazing teams and amazing people that, um, and, and I really enjoy improving, sort of meeting whatever the goals are, that, um, with the problem. So it's like, are we helping people? Would make it easier to buy an airline, to get?  Are we helping, um, uh, doing a better job of, uh, showing what kind of work a company does or really just, you know, showing their brand better, um, on the internet, are we? I And yeah, the answer is, yeah, I'm always interested in learning about new opportunities. Um, What's kind of working my most interest in?  Well, I covered that a little bit, just challenging problems. I think AI and ML, honestly, every project and software should either be powered by AI or machine learning. Um, I think it is, uh, even in its sort of current non AGI state, just is fantastically useful.  Um, and can both speed up the, the speed up how quickly you can get the work done. It can also, and cheaply, it also definitely improves the quality of the build. As far as what roles, for me.  I'm really interested in doing sort of, I like this, let's go from 0 to one and the Army of one approach, where I'll do product strategy, design, and development working, you know, with the client and with AI. I think that's pretty interesting. Um, Industries, uh, but I love just doing product strategy.  I love research. I like testing. Um, I, One thing I learned about myself is that the, the, the process for building um, and testing and shipping, and taking products to market, is one that I enjoy.  Um, it's just completely changing now with AI, but I still, I still enjoy it. Um, industries I've drawn to, I, you know, I have a, uh, love aviation, you know, and hospitality. Um, I, uh, any kind of sort of new technology, um, media.  I, there's, there's really, it's interesting with me, is like, I think, I'm a lifelong learner. Um, that's sort of evidenced by just, you know, this work with AIML, but there's lots of other reasons, but I always love learning about, um, what makes a company special. As far as company size preferences, I don't have a strong preference.  I... really do enjoy, um, an amount of agency, and I like being able to get work done. So that probably leads me a little bit to smaller companies, but I know there's plenty of enterprises where they're pretty good at getting work. Um, I, uh, since, as I live in Portland, Oregon, remote is often the best option, but I love working on site.  And, uh, Question three, types of projects. I'm not interested in doing anymore. Um, probably not military.  Probably not soda. Uh, other than that, I, I think there might be projects where I would recommend other solutions. I, you know, I definitely don't want to, uh, I genuinely want whoever is trying to solve a problem to get their solve, problem solved in the best possible.
