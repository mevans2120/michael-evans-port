Question one, what are you doing now professionally? Um. I am consulting, and I'm also, uh, have an interest in a startup called PostPal.  Um, and we are basically building, uh, an app for people who have gone through procedure and are looking for basically better, better care, and it's sort of, then, um, the sheets of paper that you get after you have a procedure, like, say, a colonoscopy, or what have you. Um, I'm interested in any kind of interesting work that, uh, things that I like. Um, I like challenging opportunities, sort of challenging problems to solve.  Um, I love working with amazing teams and amazing people that, um, and, and I really enjoy improving, sort of meeting whatever the goals are, that, um, with the problem. So it's like, are we helping people? Would make it easier to buy an airline, to get?  Are we helping, um, uh, doing a better job of, uh, showing what kind of work a company does or really just, you know, showing their brand better, um, on the internet, are we? I And yeah, the answer is, yeah, I'm always interested in learning about new opportunities. Um, What's kind of working my most interest in?  Well, I covered that a little bit, just challenging problems. I think AI and ML, honestly, every project and software should either be powered by AI or machine learning. Um, I think it is, uh, even in its sort of current non AGI state, just is fantastically useful.  Um, and can both speed up the, the speed up how quickly you can get the work done. It can also, and cheaply, it also definitely improves the quality of the build. As far as what roles, for me.  I'm really interested in doing sort of, I like this, let's go from 0 to one and the Army of one approach, where I'll do product strategy, design, and development working, you know, with the client and with AI. I think that's pretty interesting. Um, Industries, uh, but I love just doing product strategy.  I love research. I like testing. Um, I, One thing I learned about myself is that the, the, the process for building um, and testing and shipping, and taking products to market, is one that I enjoy.  Um, it's just completely changing now with AI, but I still, I still enjoy it. Um, industries I've drawn to, I, you know, I have a, uh, love aviation, you know, and hospitality. Um, I, uh, any kind of sort of new technology, um, media.  I, there's, there's really, it's interesting with me, is like, I think, I'm a lifelong learner. Um, that's sort of evidenced by just, you know, this work with AIML, but there's lots of other reasons, but I always love learning about, um, what makes a company special. As far as company size preferences, I don't have a strong preference.  I... really do enjoy, um, an amount of agency, and I like being able to get work done. So that probably leads me a little bit to smaller companies, but I know there's plenty of enterprises where they're pretty good at getting work. Um, I, uh, since, as I live in Portland, Oregon, remote is often the best option, but I love working on site.  And, uh, Question three, types of projects. I'm not interested in doing anymore. Um, probably not military.  Probably not soda. Uh, other than that, I, I think there might be projects where I would recommend other solutions. I, you know, I definitely don't want to, uh, I genuinely want whoever is trying to solve a problem to get their solve, problem solved in the best possible. 


So, finishing up with Casabonita, who is on the team? Um, it was myself, was I was the project product lead, and, um, uh, graphic designer, and a copywriter, and an engineer, and, um, uh, uh, we had sort of a tech technical consultant, my friend Vinny. Um, And I did the UX for this project.  Um, I managed the project and I helped all of with sort of technical architecture, tech setup, configured 7 rooms. I just, I, you know, I got cut off when I was talking in the soft recording, so I just want to say the tech stack was next JS. Uh, uh, with suppa base, um, reason why is just it's, you know, super modern stack that can scale, and, you know, we knew we were gonna get hammered.  Um, it was hosted on for sale. Um, and we knew that Versell scaled, and, um, stuff a base we learned scaled via, you know, uh, the sort of compute power that you give it. Um, the technical challenges, I think I can't remember if we talked about it, was queuing.  So we had like 40,000 people who, uh, when we first opened the restaurant for, for, you know, reservations and was officially open, 40,000 people waiting in a queue to get, you know, a few thousand reservations. We were doing this month by month. Um, other things that we did was, uh, so that's, uh, that queuing system, Q it really helped us solve it.  Other things that we did were... We built their support system, so a support system for the Founders Club. And, um, this allowed the Casa Bonita team to, uh, basically manage founders, you know, data, details, merge founders, create new founders if they need to.  Um, do all of the things that they would need to do to, you know, administrate the Founders Club. Because it was not going away. Um, I think the things I would do, we would do differently is I think actually switching reservation systems from, uh, uh, from open table to 7 rooms, did, well, it offered a lot of configuration, it did make some things easier.  It was very costly. And I'm not sure if it was the right decision in hindsight. Um, whether or not just sort of improving the sort of custom, um, uh, open table builds and would have been better than moving to 7 times.  Um, Other, you know, I think we talked about, uh, So, so let's talk about impact, um, you know, we kept, we kept the restaurant full. The restaurant was full at 100%. Um, and, uh, we were able to successfully sort of, you know, switch over, switch reservation systems, have increased the amount of people that you could seat in a number of covers by like 25%.  Um, and, uh, uh, Yeah, and things I'm most proud of is, you know, aside from sort of, yeah, that that measurably improving their bottom line is like we were able to hand this work off, you know, and it's a restaurant, it's not an IT company. So just being able to hand it off and have it sort of be minimally, um, What's the word? Yeah.  Okay, so that is Caspanita. Virgin America, all right. So we were building Virgin America's, uh, website, and we ultimately built their mobile app.  But the 1st thing was the website. And I think the challenge for, for, in what we learned through research was that, Most of Virgin America's business, most airlines business, is goes through, is via business travelers. People who travel frequently.  They pay high dollar for tickets, they book last minute. They are the most important customers. And they will also figure out how to use any kind of software to book a ticket.  Um, But then there are these leisure travelers who travel two or three times a year, and if you think about it, uh, an airline ticket is, like, one of the most complex things that a customer can buy, right? In a year. Like, complex product, like maybe cell phones or similar cell phone plans, but I even think you have to say who's going, you have to pick your days and times.  You have to, uh, pick your flights, you have to pick your seats. You have to make sure it aligns with your hotel and car reservations. If you're doing that, you have to enter your travel information, you have to enter your credit card.  Um, and you have to sort of also pick what kind of, you know, what kind of uh, fair, like, are you going to do economy or Maine or business, you know? Uh, there's ancillaries that were sold. Are they going to pay for an extra for, you know, a better seat?  Um, So it's very it's complicated. And so the, and and and laser travels struggle to convert. they would fail the most. And so the strategy was like, let's build it to make it simpler for leisure travelers to book a ticket, and well, the business travelers will come along for the ride.  And the other insight was if you think about how, um, websites were optimized, especially in like 2014 or 2015 when we were working on this, uh, People talked about a number of clicks. We need to reduce the number of clicks and then people will convert more. There's something correct there, but it's actually really the number of decisions, right?  So you want, if there's any way you can reduce the number of decisions that a person needs to make to complete a transaction, yes, you will improve conversion by simply reducing clicks, that doesn't actually help. And sometimes combining decisions into one click is what actually makes it more complicated. So, we broke it apart where every decision got its own space.  You got to think about who's going. Uh, what dates, times, then what fares, then the seats, then the traveler information, and then the confirmation, all in each and a step by step. Um, and that was, that was the big innovation.  Um, The text act for Virgin America. was, uh, angular. It was the biggest angular project at the time. by a significant margin. Uh, and, uh, it was, you know, bolted onto, there was a saber back end.  And we were responsible for the, uh, The front end, and we worked closely with Virgin America. I was at their office, you know, for a year, closely on on the APIs. There were many technical challenges with this.  The 1st is just saber, such saber so old, it's from the 70s, you know? And, uh, It was really innovative in the 70s was, you know, you could call a travel agent and they could figure out, you know, what's they could put you on a specific seat on a specific flight of specific days and times and you'd go to the airport and you'd have your ticket and this would all be set for you. Um, Uh, And, um, Then, uh, Yeah, so, so, but, but by, you know, 2014, 2015, this is no longer innovative, and this was, you know, quite, these, these APIs that we had to work with were very daunting, and we were working with angular, which was brand, like brand, spanking, bleeding edge technology at the time.  Single page apps were not, you know, were just starting to gain popularity. There's, you know, it's in the past 10 years, the challenges that we've had, what we had to face with Virgin just don't exist anymore. Um, you know, I think, uh, react is really, you know, sort of componentized and made made these, it's it's far less, uh, uh, what's the word?  As far less of a point of view for how you build things than angular does and did. at the time. So, it was an angular, and some of the sort of tech challenges were, We didn't want to code that much business logic into the front end. Um, and we wanted the API to handle as much business logic as possible.  It would be stateless, but it would handle the API would handle the logic. And sort of going back and forth with the API team to figure out exactly how this worked was definitely a challenge. Other challenges, um, were, uh, We didn't want to chain API requests.  So, um, So in the front end. So making sure that we could In each API request, we had enough that we needed. And there were some additional challenges of just like learning about what fair classes mean, these little letters, and those had to be in our API calls, and that was fun.  The team, I was the sort of lead product manager. Um, and client lead. Um, and worked with a design team and this is at work and co and an engineering team.  Some other learnings was just, we had just a fantastic, super rock star. I hate using the term rock star, but just very, very talented team. And we kept adding people to the project, um, as it, it, you know, it grew in scope and, uh, it, They always, we just kept hitting, hitting the jackpot as far as who we who we put onto the project.  Um, AB testing, we did some AB testing on the deals pages. Um, which, you know, I think the learning for me and from this AV test was that, uh, we did deals. It's like it feels flight deals, which come out every week.  And, um, it's, uh, just list, you know, and we had one with illustrations, which was which what we used on Virgin. Uh, these fun illustrations. We used, um, uh, photography and then we had one that was just like Google style.  And I thought the Google style would convert as it was simpler, right? You had less to think about. But for something like deals, the, uh, it was the imagery and then the illustrations and last was the Google style just straight list.  So you need to spark some emotion in order to convert, improve conversion on deals. That was the learning. Um, It won many, many awards, many, many awards.  Uh, I don't know, a bunch of webbies. It won the UX Awards, it won a con, con, Lyon, award. It just it won a ton of words at the day after it launched, it, um, was very, very popular on Twitter with sort of Twitter, the Twitter design folks.  And it, you, you, you could see everybody was very impro- because, because it was the 1st responsive airline website. uh, was a kind of design that, that sort of step by step that became very popular in e-commerce. Um, you know, decision by decision, right? Uh, an improved conversion by at least 20, you know, 15 to 20%, honestly, and, uh, was a, you know.  Uh, a big success. We worked on the app as well. The app was just as challenging.  And for that, we did, we, this was before REACT Native. Um, But we we didn't want to code the business logic into Android and into iOS that we we knew we needed to because we with the website we did have to, you know, we said we wanted to avoid coding business logic, but we did have to code some. And I think that's, honestly, I think as these single page apps have become more ubiquitous, um, having business logic in the front end is not like that universally considered bad, right?  So, Um, Uh, and we built our own framework ahead of REAC. This proved to be a big challenge, and it's definitely something I wouldn't do again, was building a framework plus an app. And I think it really slowed us down and we were late to deliver that product.  When Alaska Airlines bought Virgin, we ended up working with them. And we did a bunch of website conceptual designs. They were very interested in sort of our approach.  It took them quite a while to implement some of these designs. They just started actually coming out in the past few years. But, um, and and the companies couldn't be more different culturally, you know, virgin has just a very fun, as would say, fun, almost sexy airline brand, you know, their flight attendants, they would not hire from other airlines.  They typically wanted folks who had never worked for an airline before to work at Virgin. And Alaska was just known for its operational efficiency, always profitable, like the most profitable airline in the past 40 years has been Alaska. Um, they, they, uh, they are really good at keeping the planes in the sky as long as possible.  Um, one of the things I learned about airlines is that why would you ever start one? You have very little control over, uh, how well your business does. You have to you have to run your business well. really well.  And then you also need to have the price of gas below and demand to be high and you don't have control over the price of gas and you don't have much control over demand because that's largely influenced by the economy. Um, I asked the CMO, uh, about... Virgin and Virgin America, CMO, about this, about why would anyone start, uh, start an airline?  She had a funny joke. She said, I thought about this, and think about it. And I think it's because the planes are shaped like penises.  And if you think about it, it's mostly all men who own these airlines. Anyway, I thought that was a funny joke. Um, Uh, other things I'm proud of is like we were able to sort of address some real data science issues with how they reported on their numbers, um, both just creating like dashboards that showed meaningful conversion, you know, drop off and returning back.  Just a much more modern way to think about their business with data. And that's something that I led. Um, Uh, the before launcher.  So, Let's start start about the challenge. So... The before launcher was an idea that I had.  Because I had becoming I became incredibly distracted by my phone. It was always blowing up with folks and or just other stuff. There was a bunch of just, you know, just, it was just filled with activity.  And, you know, I think everyone's had the problem where they opened their phone. And they're thinking that they want to do something with that's the reason they open it. And they end up doing something else because of a notification or they get distracted by an app icon, et cetera.  And so the idea behind this was that, you know, we're grown ups. We need our smartphones because they're super computers in your pocket. You know, you can't go back to a dumb phone or a feature phone, as you call it, because it's, you know, how are you gonna order?  How are you gonna get a lift? It's really nice to have every song that you own in your pocket. There's just so many benefits to a smartphone that are not inherently distracting. that, uh, you're not going to get rid of it, but let's say we have a notification filter because this, a notification filter, and a cleaner interface free of like iconography.  So the notification filter, um, Basically, this was notifications themselves or can be inherently incredibly important texts from your mom, you know, important work emails, slack messages, et cetera. Or they can be inherently unimportant, like like a deal from Target or, you know, Facebook telling you something that you might be interested in. You know, just really trying to suck you back into their app.  And we filtered out the good notifications from the bad, and we let people sort of modify the filter. You still, no, you would not lose any notification. Any notifications.  The filtered notifications would appear in a list that you could check. Because sometimes you want to check deals, you know? Um, And we put it in a very simple sort of 3 swipe interface swipe, left for apps, swipe right for notifications, and then you have a favorites list.  And it was, and the notification filled, it can only be built on Android. Um, and the notification filter, we weren't even sure it was going to work. Um, we had to prototype it and, uh, and, you know, fortunately, it worked, but barely.  But it did work. And then we beta tested it with a bunch of folks, and that's sort of how we built out the onboarding because, you know, it's phones are in phones and phone interfaces are different from like an airline interface because the phone interface, you use it all the time, uh, or frequently. And so, it's fine to have things that are learnable, where with an airline booking engine, you don't want things.  I mean, you want things to be to be able to use the interface without having to learn how it works. But, um, so we built like this comprehensive onboarding, um, and we shipped it. And it was really slow.  And so basically one of the things that I learned how to do. um, on this, and this, this was a small team. It was me, an engineer. Um, and then we later had a biz ops person.  Um, and that was it. And so I did all of the design work, and, um, all the product research, and, uh, did all of this sort of AS apps or optimization work. Um, And with the App Store optimization, it was learning, sort of, you know, reading about what might work, which is, and seeing what people search for, and then also AB testing, because the uh, placer allowed you to AB test various changes.  And so, you know, I learned that video doesn't convert. You know, imagery converts, but you would think a video of your app would help, but it actually does not. Um, and, uh, And then also, you know, cultivating 5 star reviews.  The other thing I learned, in way, one, a fast company's best app of the year in 2019. Um, people loved it and it worked. You know, it we showed that, uh, Um, We showed that, uh, People who used the before launcher, I think they opened their phones 40% less. 30% less than average, you know, there's some sort of implicit bias here because there's people who are trying to open their phones less.  But, um, It was definitely meaningful, where it's not just the bias and we got plenty of positive reports that it really worked. The problem was that just financially, the business model was not, not a sustainable one. We had an idea for other apps around distracting just phone distractions, including apps that could be, um, on iOS, but the the finances were so shaky or just the business model was so shaky for this app that, um, I was just, I ultimately sold it to the developer.  Uh, one of the, and uh, he's using it, still lives on. Um, Uh, Things that I've learned is like, if I was going to start another startup, um... If I was gonna start another startup, it would be, uh, a, um...  Likely a... Likely, sorry, B to B. Like, just selling to businesses, I think, is often a more sustainable way to make, um, a buck, so to speak. Whereas consumer software often has to be given away, and you have to either sell data.  There's just lots of unsavory things that I just really was not interested in doing for it to be successful. So on to pedal.com. So pedal.com.  I was in charge of, at 1st I was in charge of the data team. Um, uh, because they, I have a, you know, bent towards analytics and we built out a, um, uh, a dashboard using snowflake snowplow, Google Analytics, um, And, uh, and really just built out this big reporting system for for pedal. And so what pedal does is they buy junk cars from people, and they make it very easy.  So if you have a car that's, you know, worth between $1000 and, you know, a few $1000 pedal will cut you a check right there. They'll go pick up your car and they'll part it out and, you know, basically, the owner of pedal grew up, his family owned a junkyard in Connecticut. And so he developed a pretty a pretty good, a really good business.  One of the better businesses that you just don't care about that much. So, we also built out their buying system. So instead of booking, you're trying to buy a car, um, but we use the, so that was the 2nd thing I helped with is with UX for the pedal.com flow.  So, um, the decision that she would have to make. Uh, in order to ship. Um, and we were able to improve their purchasing.  You know, they bought more cars. that what they want to do. By like 15%. Um, We did some changes to their homepage, you know, that had improved conversion by, you know, another 5%.  Um, uh, things that I think, I don't think we would do again is I, I just think, I joined the project sort of halfway through, and, uh, I think we would have brought the market to, I just try to bring the new booking flow to market faster. Like, there seems like there was value that was left just in development, because we wanted to wait till it was perfect before we shipped it. Um, So, getting it to market faster.  Um, the software, or what it was, the software stack, uh, was react, um, I can't remember the frameworks. I was less involved with the tech of that. Um, and, uh, with with sanity.  So I think it was the next JS app. Actually it's react, Nest JS, plus sanity. It's where I 1st started working insanity.  And, um, uh, and it hooked up with an API that, uh, you know, we worked with the client on. Um, So that, that's pedal. Um, Target?  I think I already talked to quite a bit about Target. This was earlier in my career, but we worked on so many different projects and the future of retail and so many, and I think the projects really, you know, we, we, we first started working with Target. So Target, when e-commerce 1st became a thing.  They partnered with Amazon and they sold all their products through Amazon. They realized that this was not a good long-term solution for Target, that they needed their own e-commerce system. So they started a massive project to convert, to move from Amazon to their own proprietary e-commerce engine.  And, uh, we were, as this is when I was that huge, and I was the project manager, um, and the program director for all of the program manager for all of the, all of the work streams that we had with Target. And, uh, Um, And this includes... Yeah, so all of the work streams, all of the work streams from Target.  Sorry. Um, And we worked on FF, future retail stuff, and this was conceptual work. We did design work for the e-commerce engine.  We did not do the development work. Um, sapient nitro did. This is something that was a huge.  Uh, but the future retail was super interesting because so much of it came to pass. Like the, just, you know, using QR codes as a way to, you know, extend offerings and, you know, get people onto where the internet is useful using, um, yeah, and again, the other, some, some other other things that I think we're early on is just like, they think about what's the future of retail, with digital, it's like, it's not putting a kiosk, you know, inside of your, your, your retail operation. that people don't really love using kiosks. They're kind of grimy.  They are rarely better than being in your store or in talking to your employees and your team members. So we worked on tools to make, um, the, uh, uh, team members for Target smarter. So if you give them ways to know better, know more about their inventory, know more about what's how their inventory operates.  No, knows how many people are in the store, potentially, you know, just giving them as much information that they can use to then uh, be really gracious, good team members. That was, I think, the 1st one of the bigger strategic decisions that I think. You've seen sort of come to light.  Okay, I think that's good for now. Part three. Who is Michael Evans?  Michael is a product manager. who lives in Portland, Oregon. who is a technology enthusiast, AI enthusiast, Father of two boys, who loves to learn, who is a kind of an army of one, as far as capabilities across software. Um, that comparison to what I do, product manager, I can do strategy. UX design, research, uh, analysis.  I can manage a project, um, prioritize, you know, sort of, uh, work, so prioritize, backlogs prioritize features, develop featureless develop roadmaps, develop scopes. Um, to now actually being able to build the software with club code. Build and test.  And I think that's been sort of the newest thing in my offering is just being able to work closely with Claude. One of the things that I learned is like my skill set actually aligns quite well with working with Claude. Because it's honestly, you treat, you know, Claude is kind of a team member.  Claude is a team member and giving Claude context and, you know, keeping things organized and making it clear what the reason you're doing things just really helps the output. Um, my background, I grew up, I think I told this before. Yeah, I grew up in a purple house.  In Eugene, Oregon. I got a degree in English, but out after college, I wound up working in software of a variety of roles for the past 20 years. Uh, I think there's 3 things that make me different, or maybe not different, but just I'd say that, really, make me, uh, kind of special. is I can dive really deep technically, you know, very technically adept.  About as technical as you can get without being much of a coder, right? I coded in middle school. I know some HTML and CSS.  You know, I understand how software apps are architected. But I can go there in any stripe for software. to also having really good, big picture views of what's important for a business. What's important for their customers?  So having that 50,000 foot level, true 50,000 feet, all the way down to true, deep, deep, deep in the weeds, I can go wherever is needed for the project. And I do think that some amount of, uh, some amount of, um, uh... What's the word?  I think the details are what separate great products from good products, the little things. Ideas. There's plenty of good ideas.  But there aren't as many great executions. Experience with AI, um, I've done a bunch of different projects recently, so I've coded a, uh, with, uh, uh, an app called PostPal. It is an app for people who are, uh, Um, one second.  Snap, uh, for people who... have had... Sorry. Post pal.  It's a mobile app. iOS Android, built in REAC Native. Um, And, uh... Uh...  In a web app. Um, it is for people, if you, let's say you've had a medical procedure, um, you often, if you have a medical procedure where you have to recover from it, there are do's and don'ts, and you get to sort of think, you get a, usually a pamphlet, and like, you can't take a shower for 72 hours. You have to keep your cast dry, you know, for 3 months.  You need to do some kind of physical therapy. You have to take medication. You can't take these kinds of medications, and then those don't gradually go away, and the dues gradually go away too.  Um, and so what we created was basically a way for AI to parse these PDFs, you know, because those pamphlets are generally on a PDF, and turn it into a timeline. And then also be able to customize and manage the timeline. There's an admin, a way to add new users, um, and uh, 2 different interfaces.  Um, Other AI projects has just been creating websites, really nice marketing websites for colleagues and friends. Recently did the DOA website. Um, oh, yeah, and just let's say, so PostPal is, uh, a next JS app.  And a ReACNative app, and the next JS app provides an API. Uh, that the, um, mobile app uses. And, um, The mobile app and the web app share the same design, but don't share, you know, their components are built separately.  Um, And I said, this, I learned a lot working with, and that was with using Claude Code and some, you know, a lot of different processes that I've sort of learned working with other people who, um, gentic engineering or vibe coding folks. Um, yeah, so, and back to marketing apps, so these are like react plus, uh, sanity, which just works super well. Um, and I built a site for DOA, built a site for Department of Art.  There, like a production company in Portland. for Opal Creek, which is an accounting consulting company in Portland, for Kunegat, and is a shaman in Eugene, and potentially some other folks. And these are... Really, I was just trying to prove the concept of this kind of consulting work.  You know, I think these apps are not super technical, but, um, uh, getting the design rights, actually, and the marketing right was the more challenging. And more fun thing to do for these projects. Other things that built with AI, uh, built some tools for Claude built, you know, use sort of a memory bank solution, um, and, and then sort of modified it and created sort of a hybrid memory bank with, um, that, that works pretty well, that offers context throughout the project.  I've recently built up the 3 suites of colored skills, which I've been very impressed with, the design suite, Project Suite, and the Dev Suite. Um, and since I sort of switched to GitHub and Claude, you know, because, uh, I have, like, over a thousand commits, I might get hub page is pretty, it's a lot. It's been a lot of work.  Um... My experience with product management, I've been doing it at what feels like most of my life, even though it sometimes my role is called a project manager. Um...  Biggest projects I work on is Virgin America. Technologies do I work with? Uh, typically, more frequently, front end in the back ends that support sort of user interfaces for consumer and uh, B to B apps, you know?  Um, I'm fairly like technology, agnostic, and that I can, you know, work across a variety of technologies. I work. Salesforce, I've worked with NetSuite.  I know SAS products pretty well. Um, and I've worked on sort of, you know, just complete custom builds. Um, Yes, is the answer, are you available for consulting work?  Yes. What kind of projects are you looking for? I like projects that help my clients and solve challenging problems.  Um, I'm located in Portland, in Portland. I work remotely. Um, How much do I charge?  What are my rates? Um, uh, I would say, please, please get in touch. The rates, especially for sort of like an AI builder, is much, much lower than you might find for a bigger, you know, team, and I think the quality is as high or higher.  Um, What's my opinion on the future of AI? Uh. I think, let's say right now it's October 26, 2025, and there's, you know, I think people are saying that there's an AI bubble, um, which I think, you know, looking at the numbers, I think potentially, yeah.  Um, I don't think... sort of this AGI idea or super intelligence, I think we're further away from that than we think. But I think people are underselling how useful AI is right now. You know, it is incredibly useful.  Uh, especially when you're thinking about it, it's like what's AI going to be really good at? Well, probably building itself, building software, and that's sort of proven true. I is very good at building software.  Um, Uh, And and I I think that it is something that, Also around AI that I just think that, um, the people who love to learn, it's just going to be a boon for them. And then the people who don't like to learn, I think it might have some unfortunate consequences for them. What's the most common mistake companies make with digital products?  I would say... I think the most common mistake is not having your elevator pitch nailed. Like, you should be able to explain what the app is and who it's for, within a few sentences.  And if someone doesn't understand it and needs you to elucidate or you need many paragraphs to explain what it does, uh, I think you may be trying to solve too many problems. which I think maybe that's the why behind the why is solving too many problems. Um, I think the best digital product, especially ones going from 0 to one, they solve a specific problem. And then they can grow and solve problem or solve other problems around that area, but you got to solve one problem well first.  Um, and I think that's what advice would you give someone a starting digital product? Solve a problem research. Get to know your customers, put your product in front of your customers.  You will learn so much. However you can do it, whether it's, you know, online with usabilitytesting.com, going to Starbucks. Uh, and asking people to use your app, you know, getting friends and family to use it.  It really, honestly, the how or the how you get people to use your product matters way less than that you do, get them to use it and that you look at how they use it either looking at the analytics or just watching them use your product, which I think is the best way to do it, by the way, at first. How should the chapel handle edge cases? I like humor.  Um, my humor is often dry and maybe doesn't work as well written, so, you know, it could be a little bit dry. Uh, but, like, let's say, what's the meaning of life? If someone asked me that question, I would ask them to read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which I think it's the number 42, or read Siddhartha, or, you know, Can you help me with my homework?  And answer inappropriate requests. I would... say, uh... not... I would also try to just deflect with humor and offer, uh... say that there are plenty of other places on the internet that can help you with your homework.  Are you better than X? Do you handle comparisons? Um, I would be gracious and so are you, uh, to the competitor?  and say that, um, The work that I do is world class. Part four. Tone questions.  I think it should be a mix of professional, friendly and conversational. Um, yes, humor, if it can be dry, that's better. If we use technical jargon, which is okay, explain it.  And definitely a little bit more casual than formal. Uh... Yeah, and and the example that you give in this, this, uh, next questions to answer dot MD file, it's perfect.  Yeah. Um, I think around failures, Maybe be less quick to mention them on the chat and with a chat box. I think that's better verbal than written.  Um, although... It should not peer overconfident that there are failures, but that, you know, you can say that... I failed many times, as everyone has work, you know, everybody, if...  What's my experience? Uh, with Python? Um, I've taken some Python horses.  I, but, you know, I am not an expert engineer. with, Can you help me build my product? Uh, There's, there's a... I would say, you know, uh, highly likely, you know, let's talk about it.  They asked to get in touch. Tell me about the Virgin America Project. I think the chat bot would response is like, well, I have to ask another question.  Like, what are you most interested in hearing? Like, around the technology, around the challenges. And I think that's it.  Let's see, let's see what's left after this.
