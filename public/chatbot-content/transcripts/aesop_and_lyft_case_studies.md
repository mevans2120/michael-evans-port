# Lyft Case Study

## Background

I started working with Lyft at Work & Co. The creative director from Virgin America left to join Lyft and hired us to work on their website and several projects.

## The Challenge

Lyft is a **two-sided marketplace** with drivers and riders. The product's sweet spot is when a rider can open the app, request a ride, and have a driver arrive within 3-8 minutes. To achieve this, Lyft needs the right balance of drivers and riders—essentially a supply and demand problem.

Drivers are difficult and expensive to recruit. There are two main strategies:

1. Recruiting new drivers who haven't driven for rideshare apps before
2. Getting existing drivers to drive more for Lyft

The website wasn't designed for consumers (who would use the app or App Store). Instead, it primarily served as a resource for potential drivers and customer support. We wanted to refocus the website specifically for the driver audience.

## The Solution

### Phase 1: Content and Website Redesign

We created city-specific content for major markets, focusing on what it's like to drive in each area. This included information about local Lyft offices (driver lounges), tips and tricks for becoming a better driver, and market-specific details. The project also involved rebranding and transforming the website from an afterthought into a polished resource.

### Phase 2: Driver Acquisition Flow Optimization

The existing driver signup flow was a Frankenstein system that had grown organically over time. Different forms varied by state due to different regulations (e.g., whether out-of-state IDs were accepted). The complex flow was difficult to navigate and poorly communicated disqualifications—potential drivers might spend 15 minutes filling out forms only to discover they weren't eligible.

We built an A/B test in a market where signup was relatively simple. The goal was to prove that a step-by-step acquisition flow would work better. This approach was similar to work we'd done with Virgin America.

## Results

- The new driver acquisition flow **converted 8% better**
- Driver-focused traffic to lift.com increased over time
- The website successfully shifted focus to serve potential drivers

# Aesop Case Study

## Background

Aesop is an Australian company that makes luxury hand soaps, moisturizers, and facial products. They position themselves at the intersection of nature and science—using natural ingredients while believing in proper chemistry.

## The In-Store Experience

Aesop has small retail stores with a unique **needs-based sales process**. Store associates ask customers what problems they're trying to solve (e.g., chapped lips) and what skin type they have. Based on this consultation, they recommend products or entire regimens. They often apply products to customers' hands so they can feel the texture. Once product touches the customer's hands, the likelihood of purchase is very high. Store associates are highly knowledgeable about the products.

## The Challenge

Aesop wanted a new e-commerce website. The challenge was that a website couldn't replicate the personalized, needs-based sales process—especially before sophisticated chatbots existed. However, we could make the online experience feel more like being in a store by:

- Clearly presenting product benefits in an easy-to-understand way
- Enabling product comparisons
- Leveraging their small, curated product catalog (around 100 items)

Aesop maintains a focused product line by sunsetting old products when introducing new ones. In cosmetics, it's a **hits business**—you invest heavily in R&D to create products, and if one becomes a hit, the margins are high.

## The Solution

### Technical Stack

The site was built in **React** on top of a **Hybris** e-commerce engine. Our team handled all the front-end React development while partnering with another vendor for the back-end e-commerce functionality. We worked closely with the vendor (based in India) and the client (based in Australia), traveling extensively to collaborate.

### Key Design Features

#### 1. Shoppable Navigation

We created a mega-nav that featured every product Aesop offered. On desktop, this appeared as a three-pane navigation allowing users to find products and proceed straight to checkout without visiting other pages.

#### 2. Photography and Videography

We re-shot all product photography and created new videos to capture Aesop's quirky yet luxurious brand personality.

#### 3. Product Detail Pages (PDP)

We invested the most time in PDPs, focusing on:

- Displaying products at actual size
- Clearly stating product benefits
- Including instructional videos showing proper application techniques (replicating the in-store guidance)

## Results

- Conversion improved by approximately **12%**
- The website won several design awards
- The client was extremely pleased with the work
