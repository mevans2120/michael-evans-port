## 🎨 Design Highlights

### All Variations Include:
✅ Dark mode support (automatic detection)
✅ Framer Motion animations
✅ Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
✅ Status badges (Live, In Progress, Coming Soon)
✅ External link handling
✅ Accessibility features
✅ Tailwind CSS styling
✅ Existing color palette integration

### Visual Differentiation from Case Studies:
- Case studies = Uniform 3-column grid, purple, simple hover
- AI Showcase = Unique layouts, varied colors, dynamic animations

## 💡 Recommendation: Bento Layout

**Why Bento wins:**
1. Most visually distinct from case studies grid
2. Shows all projects simultaneously (no navigation needed)
3. Contemporary, modern aesthetic
4. Colorful without being overwhelming
5. Excellent mobile responsiveness
6. Easy to maintain and update

**Alternative:** Use Terminal if targeting technical audience specifically.

## 🎯 Design Rationale

Each variation demonstrates a different approach to information architecture:

1. **Carousel** - Linear/sequential storytelling
2. **Terminal** - Hierarchical expandable structure
3. **Featured** - Priority-based with supporting content
4. **Bento** - Equal weight with visual variation

This gives you flexibility to choose based on:
- Your target audience
- Your brand personality
- Your content strategy
- Your visual preferences
