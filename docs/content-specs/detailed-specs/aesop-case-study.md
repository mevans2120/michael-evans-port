## Content Sections

### Section 1: Understanding Aesop

**Heading:** Nature Meets Science in Luxury Skincare

**Content:**

Aesop is an Australian company that makes luxury hand soaps, moisturizers, and facial products. What makes them unique is their positioning at the intersection of nature and science—they use natural ingredients while believing deeply in proper chemistry and formulation. Their brand philosophy centers on premium, luxurious products made with natural ingredients and scientific rigor. They maintain a curated, focused product line of approximately 100 items, cultivating a quirky yet sophisticated brand personality supported by highly knowledgeable staff who take a thoughtful, needs-based approach to customer service.

Aesop operates in what's known as a "hits business" in cosmetics. They invest heavily in R&D to create products, maintain a small curated catalog, and sunset old products when introducing new ones. If a product becomes a hit, the margins are very high, reflecting their focus on quality over quantity. This focused approach meant we could design for every product individually, rather than building templates for thousands of SKUs like traditional e-commerce.

---

### Section 2: The In-Store Experience

**Heading:** The Gold Standard We Needed to Match

**Content:**

To design the e-commerce experience, we first needed to deeply understand what made Aesop's retail stores special. The retail environment features small, beautifully designed stores with knowledgeable store associates who function almost like consultants. There's an intimate, personal atmosphere where products are displayed thoughtfully rather than overwhelmingly, with every detail considered from lighting to sink design.

The needs-based sales process begins with consultation. An associate asks: "What problem are you trying to solve?" They explore concerns like chapped lips, dry skin, sun damage, or anti-aging. They inquire about skin type, lifestyle, and preferences. Based on this consultation, they recommend specific products, explaining why this particular product suits this person. They might recommend a full regimen including cleanser, toner, and moisturizer, drawing on deep and detailed product knowledge.

The tactile experience is crucial. Associates apply product to customer's hands so they can feel the texture and experience the scent. Once the product touches their hands, purchase likelihood increases dramatically. The physical experience creates a connection that's fundamental to Aesop's sales success.

The challenge became clear: How do you replicate this personalized, tactile, consultative experience on a website, especially before sophisticated chatbots existed?

### Section 3: The E-commerce Challenge

**Heading:** Translating Touch and Consultation to Digital

**Content:**

Aesop wanted a new e-commerce website, but we couldn't just build a standard online store. The challenge was maintaining what made Aesop special while acknowledging the limitations of digital.

We couldn't replicate the tactile experience of feeling product textures or the scent experience that's critical for luxury cosmetics. Real-time, personalized consultation based on physical examination wasn't possible. We couldn't recreate the ambiance and atmosphere of physical stores or the human connection with knowledgeable staff.

What we could do was clearly present product benefits in an easy-to-understand way, enable product comparisons across the small catalog, and leverage the focused product line of approximately 100 items to create deep, detailed pages for each one. We could create instructional content showing how to use products and make the online experience feel considered and luxurious.

The small, curated catalog was actually an advantage. Unlike typical e-commerce with thousands of products requiring templates and systems, we could craft individual experiences for each product.

### Section 4: The Technical Stack

**Heading:** React Meets Hybris

**Content:**

We chose a technical architecture that divided responsibilities clearly across teams and continents. On the front-end, Work & Co handled all React development including custom UI components, product visualization features, the shoppable navigation system, and responsive design across devices.

For the back-end, another vendor based in India handled the Hybris e-commerce engine, managing inventory, checkout, payments, the product management system, order fulfillment integration, and international shipping logic.

The collaboration challenge was significant. The client was based in Australia, the back-end vendor was in India, and front-end development was at Work & Co in the US. This required extensive travel and coordination across different time zones and different working cultures, maintained through clear API contracts and communication protocols.

This approach worked because of clear separation of concerns. Each team could focus on their expertise. Work & Co owned the customer-facing experience while our partner owned the commerce infrastructure. We reduced complexity through well-defined interfaces.

### Section 5: Key Design Feature - Shoppable Navigation

**Heading:** Every Product, One Elegant Menu

**Content:**

One of the most innovative features was the shoppable mega-navigation system. Since Aesop only had approximately 100 products, we could feature every single product in the navigation. This wasn't a traditional navigation menu—it was a browsing and shopping tool.

The desktop experience used a three-pane navigation layout where users could browse by category, concern, or product type. They could see all relevant products without leaving the nav, with product thumbnails, names, and key benefits visible. Users could add to cart directly from navigation and proceed straight to checkout without visiting other pages.

This worked because the small catalog made it possible—it wouldn't work with 10,000 SKUs. It reduced friction in the purchase journey, allowed customers to quickly scan all options, mimicked the retail experience of seeing everything at once, and made product comparison natural and easy.

The design challenge was balancing comprehensiveness with elegance. Showing every product could feel overwhelming, but Aesop's focused catalog and our thoughtful design made it feel curated, not cluttered.

### Section 6: Product Detail Pages - The Core Experience

**Heading:** Where We Invested the Most Time

**Content:**

We invested more time in Product Detail Pages than any other part of the site. These pages needed to do the work that in-store consultations did.

Products were displayed at actual size to help customers understand what they're buying. This was especially important for premium-priced items, reducing surprise and returns while creating a sense of transparency and trust.

Clear benefit statements went beyond ingredient lists or marketing copy. We specified the problems each product solves, who it's for in terms of skin types and concerns, what makes it different from similar products, and how it fits into a regimen.

Instructional videos showed proper application techniques, replicating the in-store demonstration. They demonstrated how much product to use, which motions to use, and in what order to apply products if using multiple items. This made customers feel confident about usage.

We re-shot all product photography specifically for the site, capturing Aesop's quirky yet luxurious personality. The photography maintained consistent lighting and styling across multiple angles and contexts, showing products in use rather than just floating on white backgrounds.

Since customers can't touch the product, we described texture extensively using language like "lightweight gel texture," "rich, creamy consistency," and "absorbs quickly without residue." We were attempting to convey tactile information through language.

The goal was to make customers feel as informed and confident buying online as they would after a consultation in a retail store.

### Section 8: Results and Recognition

**Heading:** 12% Improvement and Industry Awards

**Content:**

The new e-commerce site improved conversion by approximately 12%—a significant lift for a luxury brand where typical conversion rates are already lower than mass-market retail. The site won several industry design awards, was featured in design publications, received recognition for its innovative navigation approach, and was praised for translating the retail experience to digital.

The client was extremely pleased with the work. This wasn't just about metrics—they felt we'd captured their brand and created something that aligned with their values.

For a luxury brand, conversion isn't just about numbers—it's about attracting the right customers who understand and value the brand. A 12% improvement meant we were successfully communicating Aesop's value proposition to customers who appreciated it.

The site established patterns and principles that informed Aesop's digital presence globally. We weren't just building one website—we were helping define how Aesop shows up in digital spaces.
