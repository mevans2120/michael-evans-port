## Content Sections

### Section 1: The Context

**Heading:** Joining Lyft Through Virgin America

**Content:**

We started working with Lyft at Work & Co after the creative director from Virgin America left to join Lyft. We had built a great relationship during the Virgin America project, and when they moved to Lyft, they hired Work & Co to work on their website and several other projects. This continuation of the relationship demonstrated something important about the Work & Co model: we built genuine partnerships with clients, not just transactional project relationships. The trust we'd earned at Virgin America carried over to Lyft.

The initial brief was straightforward but strategic: redesign Lyft's website and optimize it for their actual primary audience, potential drivers.

### Section 2: Understanding the Two-Sided Marketplace

**Heading:** The Supply and Demand Problem

**Content:**

Lyft is a two-sided marketplace with drivers on one side and riders on the other. Understanding this dynamic was crucial to solving their challenge. When a rider opens the app and requests a ride, a driver should arrive within 3-8 minutes. This requires the right balance of drivers and riders—essentially a supply and demand problem.

Drivers are difficult and expensive to recruit. There are two main strategies for growing driver supply: recruiting new drivers who haven't driven for rideshare apps before, and getting existing drivers to drive more for Lyft versus competitors.

The existing website wasn't designed for drivers—it was designed for consumers. But consumers don't need a website; they use the mobile app or go to the App Store. The website primarily served two audiences: potential drivers researching the opportunity and customer support for existing users. We wanted to refocus the website specifically for the driver audience, transforming it from an afterthought into a polished recruitment tool.

### Section 3: Phase 1 - Website Redesign and Content Strategy

**Heading:** Building a Driver Resource

**Content:**

The first phase focused on repositioning Lyft's website as a comprehensive resource for potential drivers. We created localized content for major markets, focusing on what it's like to drive in each specific area. This included information about local Lyft offices, driver lounges, and support centers, along with market-specific tips about traffic patterns, peak times, and popular routes. We provided insights on how to be a better driver in that specific city, realistic expectations for earnings potential in that market, and details about state and city-specific regulations.

This project involved more than just content—it was a complete rebranding effort. We transformed the website from a generic information site into a polished, professional resource that reflected Lyft's brand personality while speaking directly to the driver audience. The goal was to make potential drivers feel informed, supported, and excited about the opportunity to drive for Lyft.

### Section 4: Rebuilding the Driver Signup Flow

**Heading:** From Frankenstein System to Strategic A/B Test

**Content:**

The existing driver signup flow was a Frankenstein system—it had grown organically over time as Lyft expanded into new markets, with different requirements bolted on as needed. Forms were inconsistent across states, with different regulations creating confusion. The disqualification communication was particularly poor—potential drivers might spend 15 minutes filling out forms only to discover at the end that they weren't eligible. The flow was complex and non-linear, with unclear progress indication. We identified this as one of the most expensive problems in Lyft's business.

We needed to prove that a better flow would improve conversion, but rebuilding the entire multi-state system was too risky. Our approach was to build an A/B test in a simpler market with fewer regulations and a cleaner test environment. The new flow design incorporated three key principles: upfront qualification that told people immediately if they were eligible, a step-by-step process with clear progress indication that reduced cognitive load, and state-specific logic that routed users through appropriate flows.

This approach echoed work we'd done with Virgin America's booking flow—taking a complex, intimidating process and making it feel manageable through step-by-step progress and clear communication.

### Section 5: Results and Impact

**Heading:** 8% Improvement and Strategic Validation

**Content:**

The new driver acquisition flow converted 8% better than the existing flow. An 8% improvement in driver acquisition conversion might not sound dramatic, but consider the economics. Drivers are the most expensive part of the marketplace to acquire, and driver supply directly enables rider demand. Better conversion means lower cost per driver, and more drivers means better wait times, which attracts more riders. It's a virtuous cycle—the two-sided marketplace effect.

Beyond the raw conversion numbers, driver-focused traffic to lyft.com increased over time. The website successfully shifted from consumer-facing to driver-facing, with better qualified drivers completing the process and fewer disqualifications after starting. Most importantly, drivers had an improved experience from their first interaction with Lyft.

The A/B test proved that thoughtful UX design could meaningfully impact one of Lyft's most critical business metrics. This opened the door to rolling out the new flow to more complex markets with state-specific requirements.
