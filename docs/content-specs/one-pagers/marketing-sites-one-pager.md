# AI-Built Marketing Sites - One-Pager
## DOA, Opal Creek, and Karuna Gatton

## WHY: Proving the Concept

### The Hypothesis
Could AI-assisted development deliver high-quality marketing websites faster and more affordably than traditional agencies, while maintaining professional standards for design, performance, and security?

### The Business Reality
Small businesses and independent professionals face a harsh choice:
- **DIY Website Builders**: Cheap but generic, limited, and often unprofessional-looking
- **Traditional Agencies**: Professional results but $20K-$50K+ budgets and 3-6 month timelines
- **Freelancers**: Variable quality, communication challenges, timeline uncertainty

### The Opportunity
What if AI-powered development could deliver agency-quality websites at freelancer prices with startup-level speed?

### Three Test Cases

**1. DOA (Department of Art) - Set Construction**
- **Client**: Film and TV production company in Portland
- **Need**: Professional site showcasing set construction work
- **Challenge**: Visual-heavy portfolio requiring image optimization and fast loading

**2. Opal Creek - NetSuite ERP Consulting**
- **Client**: Enterprise consulting company in Portland
- **Need**: Professional B2B presence for NetSuite services
- **Challenge**: Security-first architecture for business consulting brand

**3. Karuna Gatton - Shamanic Healing**
- **Client**: Holistic healing practitioner in Eugene
- **Need**: Authentic, approachable wellness website
- **Challenge**: Conveying trust and professionalism for alternative medicine

### The Common Thread
These projects were about **proving the concept**: Could AI-assisted development deliver professional marketing sites that genuinely help clients grow their businesses? "The apps aren't super technical, but getting the design right and the marketing right was the more challenging and fun thing to do."
