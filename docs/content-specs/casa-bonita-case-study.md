## Content Sections

### Section 1: The Challenge

**Heading:** A Legendary Restaurant Reopens

**Content:**

Casa Bonita is a legendary Mexican restaurant in Denver, Colorado—a massive, theatrical dining experience known for cliff divers, Black Bart's Cave, and appearances in South Park. When the restaurant was acquired and prepared to reopen, the anticipation was enormous.

The challenge was clear: thousands of people wanted reservations for a restaurant with limited seating. We needed a system that could:
- Handle massive demand (potentially tens of thousands of people)
- Manage a fair queuing system
- Keep the restaurant at full capacity month after month
- Support the Founders Club (special membership program)
- Be manageable by a restaurant team, not an IT department

**The stakes:** This wasn't just about building a reservation system. It was about helping a beloved cultural institution successfully reopen after years of closure.

### Section 2: The Team & My Role

**Heading:** Building with a Lean Team

**Content:**

I served as project/product lead, responsible for:
- Product strategy and UX design
- Technical architecture planning
- Project management across all workstreams
- Tech stack selection and setup (with technical consultant support)

**Team Composition:**
- Myself (project/product lead, UX)
- Graphic designer
- Copywriter
- Engineer
- Technical consultant (Vinny, for architecture guidance)

This lean team structure meant I wore multiple hats—from strategic planning to detailed UX work to technical architecture decisions. The team size was appropriate for the project and allowed us to move quickly while maintaining quality.

### Section 3: Technical Architecture

**Heading:** Built for Scale from Day One

**Content:**

We chose a modern, scalable tech stack because we knew we'd get hammered on day one:

**Core Stack:**
- **Next.js** - Modern React framework for server-side rendering and API routes
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities and authentication
- **Vercel** - Hosting platform with automatic scaling and edge functions

**Why This Stack:**

We weren't building a typical restaurant website. We were building a platform that needed to handle:
- Tens of thousands of simultaneous users
- Real-time queue position updates
- Secure authentication for Founders Club members
- Admin interfaces for restaurant staff
- Integration with reservation systems (OpenTable, later SevenRooms)

**Key Learning:** Supabase scales based on the compute power you allocate to it. Understanding this early allowed us to properly provision resources for launch day and scale appropriately as demand patterns emerged.

---

### Section 4: The Queuing Challenge

**Heading:** 40,000 People Waiting

**Content:**

The main technical challenge was **queuing**. When we first opened reservations, we had **40,000 people in a queue** trying to get a few thousand reservations for the first month.

**The Problem:**
- Standard reservation systems aren't built for this scale
- Users need real-time feedback on their queue position
- The system must be fair (first-come, first-served)
- It has to remain stable under extreme load
- People will wait for hours—the experience must be respectful of their time

**The Solution:**

We implemented **Qit**, a specialized queuing system that:
- Handled tens of thousands of simultaneous connections
- Provided real-time queue position updates
- Ensured fair ordering and prevented gaming the system
- Integrated seamlessly with our Next.js application
- Scaled automatically based on demand

**Result:** Successfully processed 40,000 people through the queue without crashes or major issues. The system kept the restaurant at full capacity month after month.

### Section 5: Founders Club Support System

**Heading:** Administration for Non-Technical Teams

**Content:**

Beyond public reservations, Casa Bonita has a Founders Club—members who supported the restaurant's acquisition and reopening. This required a comprehensive support and administration system.

**What We Built:**
- Founder data management interface
- Ability to view, merge, and update founder records
- Create new founders when needed
- Manage founder-specific reservations and benefits
- Track founder engagement and participation

**The Critical Constraint:** This system needed to be usable by the Casa Bonita team—restaurant professionals, not IT professionals.

**Our Approach:**
- Intuitive admin interfaces with clear workflows
- Comprehensive documentation and training
- Error prevention and helpful error messages
- Support for common operations without developer intervention
- Clear audit trails for important changes

**What I'm Most Proud Of:** Beyond measurably improving their bottom line (25% more covers, 100% capacity), we successfully handed this work off to a restaurant team and made it minimally burdensome. That's a rare outcome in custom software projects.

### Section 6: Reservation System Evolution

**Heading:** OpenTable to SevenRooms Migration

**Content:**

Initially, we integrated with **OpenTable**, the industry-standard reservation system. Partway through the project, we migrated to **SevenRooms**, a more configurable platform.

**Why We Switched:**
- SevenRooms offered significantly more configuration options
- Better support for complex scenarios (Founders Club, special events)
- More powerful admin tools for the restaurant team
- Enhanced guest management and CRM features

**The Challenge:**
Migration was costly—not just in licensing fees, but in engineering time to rebuild integrations and learn a new API.

**In Hindsight:** I'm not entirely sure it was the right decision. Improving our custom OpenTable integrations might have been better than the costly migration to SevenRooms. The additional configuration was nice, but the ROI wasn't definitively positive.

**The Lesson:** Sometimes the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. When evaluating platform switches, account for the full cost—not just licensing, but engineering time, testing, training, and opportunity cost of other features you could build.

### Section 7: Results & Impact

**Heading:** Measurable Business Impact

**Content:**

**Quantifiable Results:**
- **100% capacity** - Restaurant consistently full
- **25% increase in covers** - More guests served per service period
- **40,000-person queue** successfully managed without crashes
- **Seamless handoff** to non-technical restaurant team

**Technical Success:**
- Zero downtime during high-traffic periods
- Real-time queue updates for thousands of simultaneous users
- Smooth integration with reservation platforms
- Scalable architecture that grew with demand

**Ongoing Impact:**
The system continues to operate successfully, keeping Casa Bonita full and helping manage one of Denver's most beloved dining experiences. The restaurant team manages it independently with minimal technical support.

### Section 8: Key Learnings

**Heading:** What This Project Taught Me

**Content:**

**1. Build for Scale from Day One**
Don't wait to see if you need scale—if there's any chance of high demand, architect for it from the start. We chose Next.js/Supabase/Vercel specifically because we knew we'd be hammered, and that foresight paid off.

**2. The Handoff Matters as Much as the Build**
Technical excellence is only part of success. Building something a non-technical team can manage and maintain is often more valuable than adding features. The best measure of success: they're still using it successfully without constant developer intervention.

**3. Platform Migrations Are Expensive**
The SevenRooms migration taught me to more carefully evaluate the full cost of platform switches. Sometimes improving what you have is better than switching to something new, even if the new platform has appealing features.

**4. Queuing at Scale Is Hard**
Managing tens of thousands of simultaneous users all competing for limited resources is a unique technical challenge. Using specialized tools like Qit rather than building from scratch was the right call.

**5. UX for Extreme Demand**
When 40,000 people are waiting for 1,000 spots, the UX challenge isn't conversion optimization—it's managing expectations, providing transparency, and respecting people's time. Clear communication about queue position and estimated wait times is essential.

### Section 9: The Bigger Picture

**Heading:** Technical Excellence in Service of Culture

**Content:**

Casa Bonita isn't just a restaurant—it's a cultural institution. A place that brings joy to families, creates memories, and represents a uniquely Colorado experience. The technical work we did was in service of that mission.

**The Responsibility:**
When you're working on something people genuinely love and have been waiting years to experience again, you feel the weight of that responsibility. The technical decisions—from choosing the tech stack to designing the queuing system to ensuring a smooth handoff—all served the goal of helping Casa Bonita succeed.

**The Outcome:**
The restaurant is thriving. It's consistently full. People are experiencing the cliff divers, the sopapillas, and the joy that makes Casa Bonita special. The technical infrastructure works invisibly in the background, doing exactly what it should: supporting the experience without getting in the way.

**That's the best kind of technical work**—when it serves a purpose bigger than itself and disappears into successful execution.
