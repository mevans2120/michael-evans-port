## Content Sections

### Section 1: The Context

**Heading:** Huge's Biggest Client

**Content:**

Target was one of Huge's biggest clients, generating the most revenue that year. The scale of the engagement was massive—I traveled to Minneapolis every week, working on approximately 20 different concurrent projects.

My role encompassed both tactical and strategic work:
- **Project Manager** for individual work streams
- **Program Manager** coordinating across all Target projects
- **Strategic Partner** helping define the future of retail

This wasn't a typical agency engagement. The breadth of work, the strategic importance, and the long-term partnership created unique challenges and opportunities.

---

### Section 2: The E-commerce Challenge

**Heading:** Breaking Up with Amazon

**Content:**

When e-commerce first became mainstream, Target made what seemed like a pragmatic decision: partner with Amazon to sell all their products online. Amazon had the infrastructure, the expertise, and the platform.

**The Problem:**
Target quickly realized this wasn't a sustainable long-term solution. They were:
- Giving Amazon valuable customer data and relationships
- Limited in their ability to control the experience
- Building Amazon's business more than their own
- Unable to differentiate their digital experience

**The Decision:**
Target initiated a massive project to move from Amazon to their own proprietary e-commerce engine. This wasn't just a platform migration—it was a fundamental shift in how Target approached digital commerce.

**Our Role at Huge:**
We did the design work for the new e-commerce engine while Sapient Nitro handled development. This division of labor—design at Huge, development at Sapient Nitro—required close coordination and clear communication.

---

### Section 3: The Power of Inspirational Strategy

**Heading:** Why Strategy Matters

**Content:**

One of the biggest learnings from the Target engagement was **the value of having a strategy that inspires people**.

**Target's Strategy:**
Being the place that people love and selling products people love.

**Walmart's Strategy (by contrast):**
More transactional, efficiency-focused, price-driven.

This difference in strategic positioning affected everything:
- How we designed experiences
- What we optimized for (love vs. efficiency)
- How we talked about the work
- How Target team members engaged with customers

**Why It Worked:**
The partnership worked so well because Target's inspirational strategy gave us a North Star. We weren't just building an e-commerce platform—we were creating a place people would love to shop. That's a fundamentally different design challenge.

**The Lesson:**
An inspirational strategy doesn't just guide decisions—it energizes teams, aligns stakeholders, and creates better outcomes. Target's "place people love" strategy was more than marketing copy; it was a framework for making thousands of daily decisions.

### Section 4: The Future of Retail

**Heading:** What We Got Right (and Wrong)

**Content:**

Beyond the immediate e-commerce work, we did forward-thinking conceptual work on the future of retail. Looking back from 2025, it's fascinating to see what came to pass and what didn't.

**What We Predicted:**

1. **QR Codes Extending Offerings**
   - We proposed using QR codes to bridge physical and digital
   - At the time, I was skeptical (wrong again!)
   - QR codes became ubiquitous, especially post-pandemic

2. **Internet Where It's Actually Useful**
   - Using digital to enhance, not replace, the in-store experience
   - Focused on practical applications, not technology for technology's sake

**The Big Strategic Insight:**

**What DOESN'T Work:**
Putting kiosks inside retail stores. People don't really love using kiosks—they're often grimy, confusing, and rarely better than talking to an employee or shopping on your own phone.

**What DOES Work:**
Building tools to make team members smarter. Give employees technology to:
- Know more about inventory (what's in stock, where it is)
- Understand how inventory flows through the store
- Potentially know how many people are in the store
- Access customer information to provide better service
- Have as much information as possible to be gracious, helpful team members

**The Philosophy:**
Technology should empower employees, not replace them. The future of retail isn't eliminating human interaction—it's making human interactions more informed, more helpful, and more delightful.

**The Outcome:**
This became one of the bigger strategic decisions that I think you've seen come to light across retail. Modern retail increasingly focuses on empowering store employees with mobile tools rather than forcing customers to use in-store kiosks.

### Section 5: Managing at Enterprise Scale

**Heading:** 20 Projects, One Program

**Content:**

Managing 20+ concurrent work streams for an enterprise client taught me invaluable lessons about program management, stakeholder alignment, and strategic coordination.

**The Challenges:**

1. **Coordination Complexity**
   - Multiple teams working on interdependent features
   - Different timelines and priorities across projects
   - Need for consistent design language and UX patterns
   - Technical dependencies between work streams

2. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Weekly travel to Minneapolis for in-person meetings
   - Aligning Huge's design team with Sapient Nitro's development team
   - Managing Target's internal stakeholders across departments
   - Balancing immediate needs with long-term strategic goals

3. **Maintaining Quality at Scale**
   - Ensuring design consistency across 20+ projects
   - Preventing duplicated effort or conflicting solutions
   - Keeping strategic vision alive in day-to-day execution
   - Managing scope creep across multiple work streams

**What Worked:**

- **Clear Strategy:** Target's "place people love" gave us a decision-making framework
- **Regular Cadence:** Weekly in-person meetings maintained alignment
- **Distributed Ownership:** Individual project managers for each work stream
- **Program-Level Oversight:** My role coordinating across all projects
- **Partnership Mindset:** Treating Target as a partner, not just a client

### Section 6: Data Modernization

**Heading:** Modern Analytics for Modern E-commerce

**Content:**

Beyond design and strategy, I led significant work modernizing how Target thought about data.

**The Problem:**
Target had real data science issues with how they reported their numbers. Traditional retail metrics didn't translate well to e-commerce, and they lacked visibility into digital customer behavior.

**What We Built:**
Created dashboards that showed:
- Meaningful conversion metrics
- Drop-off points in the purchase funnel
- Return customer behavior and patterns
- A much more modern way to think about their business with data

**The Impact:**
This data modernization work was something I personally led and am proud of. It helped Target make data-driven decisions about their e-commerce platform and understand customer behavior in ways that weren't previously possible.

**The Learning:**
At enterprise scale, data infrastructure and analytics are as important as the customer-facing experience. You can't optimize what you can't measure, and you can't measure what you don't instrument properly.

---

### Section 7: Key Learnings

**Heading:** Enterprise Lessons

**Content:**

**1. Scale Requires Different Approaches**
Managing 20 projects isn't 20 times harder than managing one—it's exponentially harder. You need different tools, processes, and mindsets at enterprise scale.

**2. Strategy Alignment Is Everything**
With multiple teams and stakeholders, a clear, inspirational strategy is the difference between chaos and coordination. Target's "place people love" strategy was worth its weight in gold.

**3. Empower, Don't Replace**
The most successful technology enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them. This applies to retail employees, customer service, and most other domains.

**4. Long-term Partnerships Beat Transactional Projects**
The weekly travel, the ongoing relationship, the deep understanding of Target's business—these created value that short-term projects never could.

**5. Data Is Infrastructure**
Modern analytics and reporting aren't nice-to-haves—they're essential infrastructure for making good decisions about digital products.

**6. Predictions Are Hard**
I was wrong about QR codes. Being humble about what the future holds and staying curious about emerging technologies is essential.

### Section 8: Reflections on Retail

**Heading:** The Bigger Picture

**Content:**

The Target engagement was about more than e-commerce. It was about the fundamental question: **What is the role of technology in retail?**

Our answer: Technology should make shopping more delightful, employees more capable, and businesses more sustainable—in that order.

**Not:**
- Replace employees with kiosks
- Prioritize efficiency over experience
- Copy what tech companies do without understanding retail

**Instead:**
- Empower employees to provide better service
- Use data to understand customers, not manipulate them
- Build experiences people genuinely love

**The Legacy:**
Many of the concepts we developed have become standard practice in modern retail:
- Mobile tools for store employees
- Integrated inventory systems
- Data-driven merchandising
- Seamless omnichannel experiences
- QR codes for product information and checkout

The work we did with Target helped shape how one of America's largest retailers thinks about the intersection of physical and digital commerce. That's something I'm genuinely proud of.
