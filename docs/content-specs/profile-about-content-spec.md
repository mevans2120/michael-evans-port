## Core Sections

### Section 1: Who I Am

**Heading:** The 50,000-Foot View

**Content:**

I'm a product manager who lives in Portland, Oregon. Technology enthusiast, AI enthusiast, father of two boys, lifelong learner, and kind of an "army of one" when it comes to capabilities across software.

**What makes me different:**

Compared to a typical product manager, I can do:
- **Strategy** - Define what to build and why
- **UX Design** - Create the interface and experience
- **Research** - Understand users and validate ideas
- **Analysis** - Make sense of data and metrics
- **Project Management** - Ship things on time
- **Prioritization** - Backlogs, roadmaps, feature lists
- **Development** - Build and test the software with Claude Code *(new!)*

That last one is new. Working with AI has transformed how I work—I can now take projects from strategy through to working code, all while maintaining the product thinking that's been at the core of my career for 20 years.

### Section 2: Background & Journey

**Heading:** From Yurts to Gigahertz

**Content:**

I was raised by hippies in a purple house in Eugene, Oregon. I fell in love with computers and software as a kid, learned to program a bit when I was 11, but I also love to read and write... So I studied English at the University of Colorado

**20 Years in Software:**

I've been doing product management for much of my career, even though sometimes my role was called "project manager" or "solutions architect" or "business analyst" The titles changed, but the work remained consistent: understand the problem, design the solution, ship the product, measure the results, iterate.

**Career Highlights:**
- Work & Co (Virgin America, Alaska Airlines)
- Huge (Target, multiple enterprise clients)
- Before Labs (Founder, Before Launcher)
- Independent Consulting & Raw Materials (Casa Bonita, Peddle, PostPal)
- Current: AI-powered product development

**The Thread:**
Whether it was helping leisure travelers book airline tickets, helping people focus by filtering notifications, or managing 40,000 people in a queue for a restaurant, the work has always been about making complex things simple and delightful.

### Section 3: Three Things That Make Me Special

**Heading:** What I Bring

**Content:**

**1. Deep Technical Knowledge**

I'm as technical as you can get without being much of a coder. I coded in middle school, know HTML and CSS, and understand how software applications are architected. I can go deep technically in any stripe of software—whether it's Salesforce, NetSuite, SaaS products, or complete custom builds.

This technical depth means I can:
- Have meaningful conversations with engineers
- Make informed architecture decisions
- Understand constraints and trade-offs
- Design solutions that are technically feasible
- Work effectively with Claude Code to build production software

**2. Big Picture Business View**

I'm really good at seeing what's important for a business and their customers at the 50,000-foot level. I understand that technology exists to serve business goals, and business goals exist to serve customers.

This strategic perspective means I can:
- Align product decisions with business objectives
- Prioritize ruthlessly based on impact
- Communicate value to stakeholders
- Think beyond features to outcomes
- Ask "should we build this?" before "how do we build this?"

**3. Range**

I can go from true 50,000 feet all the way down to deep in the weeds—wherever is needed for the project.

One day I'm defining product strategy with executives. The next I'm reviewing button padding with designers. Then I'm debugging API responses with engineers. This range is rare and valuable.

**The Details Matter:**
I think the details are what separate great products from good products—the little things. There are plenty of good ideas, but not as many great executions.

### Section 4: About My Work

**Heading:** What I Do & How I Do It

**Content:**

**The 0-to-1 Army of One Approach:**

I specialize in taking products from 0 to 1, doing product strategy, design, and development—now powered by AI. This "army of one" approach means I can move fast, stay aligned from strategy through to code, and deliver high-quality work at a fraction of traditional team costs.

**My Process:**
- **Strategy** - What should we build and why?
- **Research** - What do users actually need?
- **Design** - How should it work?
- **Development** - Build it with Claude Code
- **Testing** - Does it work? Do users love it?
- **Shipping** - Get it to market
- **Measuring** - What happened? What should we do next?
- **Iterating** - Make it better

**What I've Built with AI:**
- **PostPal** - Medical procedure recovery app (React Native + Next.js)
- **Marketing Websites** - DOA, Opal Creek, Coronagaten, and others (React + Sanity)
- **Claude Tools** - Custom memory bank, 3 skill suites (Design, Project, Dev)
- **1,000+ GitHub Commits** - Since switching to Claude Code

**Industries & Problems I Love:**
- **Aviation** - Virgin America was my biggest project, love the complexity
- **Hospitality** - Casa Bonita, reservation systems, high-volume challenges
- **New Technology** - AI/ML, emerging platforms, bleeding edge
- **Media** - Streaming, content delivery, user engagement

If it's challenging and helps people, I'm interested.

**Technologies I Work With:**

Front-end and back-ends supporting user interfaces for consumer and B2B apps. Technology agnostic and comfortable with:
- React, Next.js, Vite, TypeScript
- Sanity CMS (used extensively)
- Supabase, Firebase
- React Native for mobile
- AI/ML integration (Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini)
- Salesforce, NetSuite, various SaaS platforms

**Work Style:**

Based in Portland, Oregon. Work remotely most of the time, but love working on-site when it makes sense. I traveled to Minneapolis weekly for Target—when the work requires it, I'm there.

**What I'm NOT Interested In:**
- Probably not military
- Probably not soda
- Otherwise, I genuinely want whoever is trying to solve a problem to get their problem solved in the best possible way—even if that means I'm not the right person for it

### Section 5: Philosophy & Principles

**Heading:** How I Think About Products

**Content:**

**Start with the Problem:**

The most common mistake companies make is not having their elevator pitch nailed. You should be able to explain what the app is and who it's for within a few sentences.

If someone doesn't understand it, or you need many paragraphs to explain what it does, you may be trying to solve too many problems.

**The best digital products, especially 0-to-1 products, solve a specific problem.** Then they can grow and solve other problems around that area, but you have to solve one problem well first.

**Put It in Front of Users:**

Solve a problem. Research. Get to know your customers. Put your product in front of your customers.

You will learn so much. However you can do it:
- Online with usabilitytesting.com
- Going to Starbucks and asking people to use your app
- Getting friends and family to use it

Honestly, the how matters way less than that you do get them to use it, and that you look at how they use it—either looking at analytics or watching them use your product (which is the best way at first).

**The Details Matter:**

I think the details are what separate great products from good products—the little things. There are plenty of good ideas, but not as many great executions.

**Decisions Over Clicks:**

One of my core insights from Virgin America: it's not about the number of clicks—it's about the number of decisions. If you can reduce the number of decisions a person needs to make to complete a transaction, you'll improve conversion.

Simply reducing clicks doesn't help, and sometimes combining decisions into one click makes it more complicated.

**Empower, Don't Replace:**

Technology should make people more capable, not replace them. From Target's employee tools to Before Launcher's notification filter—the best technology enhances human capability.

### Section 7: Current Work & Availability

**Heading:** Let's Work Together

**Content:**

**Am I available for consulting?** Yes.

**What kind of projects am I looking for?**

Projects that help my clients and solve challenging problems. I'm especially interested in:
- 0-to-1 product development
- AI/ML integration
- Conversion optimization
- Complex booking/transaction flows
- Data infrastructure and analytics
- Product strategy and research

- Challenging consulting projects
- AI-powered product development

**Can you help me build my product?**

Highly likely—let's talk about it. Get in touch.

### Section 8: Personal

**Heading:** Beyond Work

**Content:**

**Father of two boys** living in Portland, Oregon.

**Lifelong learner** - evidenced by this work with AI/ML, 20 years in constantly evolving technology, and a genuine curiosity about what makes companies special.

**Grew up in a purple house in Eugene, Oregon** - this is not a metaphor, the house was actually purple.

**Degree in English**, not computer science. Proof that you don't need a CS degree to have a successful career in software—you need curiosity, persistence, and a willingness to learn.

**Humor:** I like humor. My humor is often dry and maybe doesn't work as well written. If you ask me the meaning of life, I'll tell you to read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the answer is 42) or Siddhartha.

## Notes for Implementation

**Tone:** Professional but approachable. Confident without being arrogant. Technical but accessible. Conversational without being casual.

**Voice:** First person. Direct. Honest about strengths and limitations. Shows personality (purple house, dry humor, English degree).

**Structure:** Progressive disclosure - start broad (who I am), get specific (what I do), end with action (let's work together).

**Differentiation:** The combination of product management + UX + development + AI is rare. Emphasize the "army of one" 0-to-1 approach.

**Credibility:** Let the projects speak. Don't oversell—the results (15-20% conversion, Fast Company award, 40K queue, etc.) are impressive enough.
