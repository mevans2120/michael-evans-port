**Project:** Michael Evans Portfolio
**Feature:** Collapsible Right-Side Chat Panel with AI Navigation
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Batch:** concepts-batch-1-102725

---

## Executive Summary

Three distinct design concepts for an AI chatbot interface that integrates with the portfolio site. Each concept presents a unique aesthetic direction while maintaining the core functionality: a collapsible right-side panel that pushes content left, AI-powered navigation to portfolio sections, and responsive behavior.

**Core Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Right-side collapsible panel (VS Code/Cursor style)
- ✅ Pushes content left instead of overlaying
- ✅ AI function calling for navigation
- ✅ Default state: Partially visible tab/handle
- ✅ Auto-collapse after navigation
- ✅ ~400px width when expanded
- ✅ Mobile: Full overlay modal (noted for future implementation)

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Start with partial visibility, expand on demand
2. **Content First:** Panel pushes content rather than covering it
3. **Intelligent Automation:** AI auto-collapses after navigation
4. **Familiar Patterns:** VS Code/Cursor-inspired interactions
5. **Performance:** Smooth 60fps animations with GPU acceleration
6. **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA labels

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

All concepts use:
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React hooks** for state management

The concepts are production-ready and can be integrated directly into the Next.js application with minor adjustments for:
- Mobile responsive behavior
- Real Anthropic API integration
