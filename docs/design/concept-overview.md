## Design Challenge

Transform Michael Evans' portfolio from a static presentation into an **interactive, engaging experience** that demonstrates technical credibility and tells compelling project stories.

### Key User Jobs to Solve

1. **Evaluate Technical Credibility** (Sarah Chen, Startup CTO)
   - "I need to see code samples and understand his AI/ML approach"
   - **Success**: Interactive demos that prove technical skill

2. **Understand Value Proposition** (Marcus Williams, Agency Partner)
   - "I need to see how he solves complex problems and handles diverse projects"
   - **Success**: Rich case studies showing process and outcomes

3. **Quick Assessment** (Emily Rodriguez, HR Recruiter)
   - "I need to filter projects by relevant tech stack and quickly scan capabilities"
   - **Success**: Tag filtering that surfaces relevant work instantly

## Features Being Designed

### 1. Interactive Project Demos
**Goal**: Let visitors experience the work, not just read about it
**Current Gap**: No live demos, code previews, or interactive prototypes
**Impact**: 85% of recruiters value live demos; boosts engagement by 55%

### 2. Expanded Case Study Format (6-Section)
**Goal**: Tell the complete story from problem to solution to impact
**Current Gap**: Minimal case study depth, no process visualization
**Impact**: Immersive storytelling builds trust and demonstrates thought leadership

### 3. Project Filtering/Tagging System
**Goal**: Help visitors quickly find relevant work by technology or category
**Current Gap**: All projects mixed together, no way to filter
**Impact**: AI-driven filters can double client inquiries

## Design Principles (From Research)

1. **Show, Don't Tell** - Make work interactive and tangible
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity through scroll and interaction
3. **Motion with Purpose** - Every animation guides attention or provides feedback
4. **Credibility Through Specificity** - Metrics and details build trust
5. **Delight in the Details** - Micro-interactions show craftsmanship

## Brand/Design Constraints

**Color System**:
- Background: `hsl(240 10% 3%)` - Deep dark blue-black
- Foreground: `hsl(0 0% 98%)` - Off-white
- Accent: `hsl(276 100% 75%)` - Vibrant purple (`#C680FF`)
- Card: `hsl(280 25% 12%)` - Slightly lighter dark
- Border: `hsl(280 25% 20%)` - Subtle purple-gray

**Typography**:
- Font: Inter (currently), font-weight: 300 (light)
- Opportunity: Add serif for headlines (Playfair Display, Instrument Serif)

**Animations**:
- Framer Motion 11.18.2 available
- Custom animations: fade-in, slide-up, slow-pulse

**Component Library**:
- shadcn/ui (50+ components available)
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling

## Concept Approach

For each feature, I've created **3 distinct concept variations** that explore different:
- Information architecture (what's shown where)
- Interaction models (how users engage)
- Visual hierarchies (what's emphasized)
- Technical approaches (implementation complexity)

Each concept includes:
- **Strengths**: What this does well
- **Tradeoffs**: What this sacrifices
- **Use Cases**: When to use this approach
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical considerations

## Next Steps

1. **Review Concepts**: Examine each variation in browser
2. **Gather Feedback**: Share with 2-3 target users (CTO, recruiter, partner)
3. **Choose Direction**: Select one concept per feature (or hybrid)
4. **Validate Feasibility**: Confirm technical implementation is achievable
5. **Move to Production Design**: Develop detailed specifications

## Open Questions

1. **Video Hosting**: Should we use Loom embeds, YouTube unlisted, or Cloudinary?
2. **Demo Complexity**: How much interactivity in demos vs. static screenshots?
3. **Case Study Length**: Target word count per section? (Current: ~200 words total)
4. **Filter Persistence**: Should filter selections persist across page navigation?
5. **Analytics**: What events should we track? (Demo views, filter usage, scroll depth?)
