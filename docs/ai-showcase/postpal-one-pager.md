# PostPal - AI-Powered Post-Procedure Recovery - One-Pager

## WHY: The Paper Pamphlet Problem

### The Problem
After medical procedures—colonoscopies, surgeries, dental work—patients receive discharge instructions on paper pamphlets. These critical documents contain time-sensitive care instructions:
- "No shower for 72 hours"
- "Keep cast dry for 3 months"
- "Do physical therapy daily for 6 weeks"
- "Take medication X, avoid medication Y"

**The Reality:**
- Instructions are complex, time-bound, and easy to misunderstand
- Paper gets lost, water-damaged, or misplaced
- Patients struggle to remember which restrictions still apply
- Missing critical care steps delays recovery or causes complications
- Providers have no visibility into patient compliance

### The Human Cost
- **Readmissions**: Preventable complications from missed instructions
- **Extended Recovery**: Patients unsure when they can resume activities
- **Provider Burden**: Repeated calls asking "Can I shower yet?" "When can I drive?"
- **Patient Anxiety**: Uncertainty about recovery timeline and restrictions

### The Opportunity
What if discharge instructions could transform from static paper into intelligent, personalized timelines that guide patients through every stage of recovery?
