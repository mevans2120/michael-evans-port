# Phase 2 Hybrid Search Implementation Results
**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: Partially Successful - Limited Improvement

## Summary
Phase 2 implementation of hybrid search and query preprocessing has been completed but shows limited improvement. Only 3 out of 12 failing questions were fixed, falling short of our target.

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Query Preprocessor ✅
- Built intelligent query normalization
- Entity extraction (Michael, Casa Bonita, HBO, etc.)
- Keyword extraction for better matching
- Query expansion with contextual terms
- **Status**: Working as expected

### 2. Hybrid Search ✅
- Combines semantic vector search with keyword search
- Weighted scoring (70% semantic, 30% keyword)
- Deduplication of results
- Fixed RPC parameter ordering issue
- **Status**: Working after fix

## Test Results

### Phase 2 Test Results (12 Previously Failing Questions)
- **Fixed**: 3/12 (25%)
- **Still Failing**: 9/12 (75%)

### Questions Fixed
✅ Q2: What did Michael study in college?
✅ Q3: How did Michael get into technology?
✅ Q24: What AI projects has Michael built recently?

### Questions Still Failing
❌ Q1: Where did Michael Evans grow up? (Eugene, Oregon)
❌ Q7: What was Michael's first job in tech? (Symantec)
❌ Q10: When did Michael become interested in AI?
❌ Q17: What did Michael build for HBO? (HBO Go)
❌ Q18: Describe the Lyft project
❌ Q29: Tell me about Michael opening the Portland office
❌ SA-2: How many people could the membership system handle?
❌ SD-1: How long did it take to solve?
❌ SE-0: What is Michael working on now?

## Analysis

### What's Working
1. **Query preprocessing** correctly extracts entities and keywords
2. **Hybrid search** runs without errors after RPC fix
3. **Some improvement** - 3 questions that previously failed now work

### Root Cause of Limited Improvement
The limited improvement suggests the issue is deeper than retrieval mechanics:

1. **Content Gap**: Many failing questions require information that may not exist in the current content
   - Q1 (Eugene, Oregon) - Likely not in documents
   - Q7 (First job at Symantec) - Likely missing
   - Q17 (HBO Go project) - Likely not detailed enough

2. **FAQ Chunks Not Indexed**: The FAQ chunks we added may not be properly indexed
   - Need to verify FAQ content is in vector DB
   - May need to re-run ingestion

3. **Retrieval Still Missing Content**: Even with hybrid search, we're not finding the right chunks
   - Suggests content exists but isn't being matched
   - May need better chunking strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify FAQ indexing**: Check if FAQ chunks are actually in the vector DB
2. **Re-ingest all content**: Ensure all content including FAQs is properly indexed
3. **Test specific content retrieval**: Directly query for known content

### Phase 2 Continuation
4. **Optimize chunking strategy** (Next in plan)
   - Increase chunk size to 800
   - Increase overlap to 200
   - Preserve Q&A pairs intact

### Phase 3 Considerations
If chunking doesn't solve it:
- Add metadata enrichment
- Implement result re-ranking
- Consider dual embedding strategy

## Key Finding
**The problem appears to be primarily a content indexing issue rather than a retrieval algorithm issue.** The hybrid search and query preprocessing are working correctly, but they can't retrieve content that isn't properly indexed or doesn't exist.

## Recommendation
1. First, verify and fix content indexing (re-ingest with FAQ chunks)
2. Then optimize chunking parameters
3. Only proceed to Phase 3 if content is confirmed indexed but still not retrieved

## Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Baseline | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Target |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Failing Questions | 12/55 (21.8%) | ~9/55 (16%) | 9/55 (16%) | <3/55 (<5%) |
| Fixed from Original 12 | 0/12 | 3/12 | 3/12 | 12/12 |
| Response Time | 5.7s | ~5s | ~5s | <6s |

## Conclusion
Phase 2 hybrid search implementation is technically successful but shows limited practical improvement. The core issue appears to be content indexing rather than retrieval mechanics. Next step should focus on verifying and fixing content indexing before proceeding with more complex optimizations.
