## Quick Decision Guide

**"I want my chatbot to handle basic questions ASAP"**
â†’ Follow `NEXT-QUESTIONS-TO-ANSWER.md` first (60 min)

**"I want my chatbot to explain my AI projects"**
â†’ Use new `ai-projects-questionnaire.md` (2-3 hours)

**"I want the best possible chatbot"**
â†’ Do both (3-4 hours total)

**"I'm overwhelmed, what's the absolute minimum?"**
â†’ Just do:
1. Current state (5 min)
2. Casa Bonita (15 min)
3. Top 2 AI projects (40 min)
**Total: 60 minutes**

## Questions?

The AI Projects Questionnaire is comprehensive because it needs to cover:
- Multiple complex projects
- Deep technical details
- Code examples
- Architecture decisions
- Comparative analysis

Don't feel like you need to answer everything at once. Even covering your top 2-3 AI projects in detail will dramatically improve your chatbot's ability to discuss your technical work.

**Remember:** The chatbot can only answer questions about what it knows. The more detailed your answers, the better it can represent you!

---

**Next:** Choose your approach above and start recording/writing answers. Even 30-60 minutes of focused content will make a huge difference in chatbot quality.
