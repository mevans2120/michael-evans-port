## Tips for Great Voice Recordings

### Do's:
✅ Be conversational and natural
✅ Tell stories - specifics make better training data
✅ Include numbers and metrics when you can
✅ Mention specific technologies, companies, and timeframes
✅ Share your opinions and perspectives
✅ Explain your reasoning for decisions
✅ Give examples from real projects

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't try to be too formal or scripted
❌ Don't worry about perfect grammar
❌ Don't censor yourself too much (you can edit transcripts later)
❌ Don't skip details thinking they're "too technical"
❌ Don't leave out failures or challenges (they make great learning stories)

### Remember:
The chatbot will be representing you to potential clients, collaborators, and employers. The more authentic, detailed, and specific you are in these recordings, the better the chatbot will be at having meaningful conversations on your behalf.
