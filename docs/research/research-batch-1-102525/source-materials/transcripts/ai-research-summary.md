## Overview

After wrapping up the Casa Bonita digital product launch in early 2024, Michael conducted extensive research into AI-powered coding tools. The research combined:
- **User interviews** with 13 professional colleagues
- **Hands-on experimentation** building applications with AI
- **Concept development** exploring future AI applications
- **Personal learning** about where AI development is headed

---

## Motivation & "Oh Shit" Moment

**The Catalyst:**
- After being laid off in March 2024, Michael finally had time to explore AI deeply
- Set out to answer: "Using AI, could I design, develop, and ship something useful all by myself?"
- Built a working Dungeons & Dragons app with his son in just one hour using Replit
- **Realization:** "You can actually build something useful that would typically take days… in hours."

**Key Questions That Emerged:**
- In five years, could someone ask Claude to "build me an airline website" and have it do most of the work?
- Will AI unlock a wave of new products that previously weren't feasible or cost-effective?
- What does this mean for the tech industry workforce?
- What does this mean for his children's future careers?

## Present Findings (How AI is Used Today)

### Finding 1: AI is Central to Daily Work
**Summary:** Most participants use AI every day, with many experiencing "holy shit" moments about its transformative power.

**Key Points:**
- Most use AI daily; over half use and pay for multiple chatbots
- Several had already built useful products primarily with AI
- Many had moments of awe realizing AI's power would change their world
- AI made surprising inroads in complex tasks like moderating user interviews (Genway)
- Those who didn't use AI were the most skeptical

**Notable Quotes:**
- "I use it everyday. It is embedded in every project I work on. I insist on it"
- "I'm at the same level of 'holy shit' that you were when you dove in deep"
- "One of the reasons we started this company was because by using AI (and other technological improvements) we could do it with a smaller team"
- "It's fundamental to our company now. Every developer has copilot, every department uses it for something"
- "It's a bunch of hype. I think it dies down, or is underwhelming, like self driving cars"

### Finding 2: Most Exciting/Terrifying Time in Technology
**Summary:** With few exceptions, everyone thought AI was the most transformational technology in their careers.

**Key Points:**
- Compared to social media introduction, but many thought it was much bigger
- Several had never been more excited about working in technology
- Most thought the technology industry workforce would be much smaller in the future
- Even skeptics acknowledged AI's potential (e.g., taking down Google Search)

**Notable Quotes:**
- "I've been doing this for 20 years, and I've never been more excited about the work"
- "If AI ceased to get any better than it is now, there is at least half a decade of work creating new products and improving existing ones"
- "This is the app that is going to eat the world. Maybe in a good way. Maybe not. I don't know"
- "Social media fundamentally changed the way we communicate... Somehow this feels bigger"

### Finding 3: Rise of Single-Use Applications
**Summary:** Several non-developers built single-use applications for personal and business needs—apps that wouldn't have been worth the effort without AI.

**Key Points:**
- Non-developers creating functional applications for specific use cases
- These applications are still in active use
- Solved very specific, often personal problems
- Made previously infeasible projects viable

**Notable Quotes:**
- "I partnered with Claude to build two apps for personal projects. And while it took a couple months, and Claude's rate limits were annoying, I wouldn't have been able to do it otherwise"
- "I made an app with Replit. In a day, I have working code that integrates with Github and SendGrid... We'll use this to manage deployments"
- "I had this technical debt that had been on my plate for over a year. It was shameful. I finally gave it to ChatGPT and it knocked it out in an hour"

### Finding 4: AI Feels Overhyped (Paradoxically)
**Summary:** Even those who believed AI would be transformational thought the hype machine was out of control.

**Key Points:**
- Several noted the researcher "lives under a rock" since AI's impact was self-evident
- Four people were tired of talking about AI (discussed non-stop since ChatGPT launched)
- AI over-marketing reminiscent of when "everyone needed an app"

**Notable Quotes:**
- "I'm tired of talking about AI. It's just a technology. Sure it's useful, but AI doesn't need to be in your bananas"
- "It reminds me of when everyone thinks they need to have an app... And in hindsight, 90% of them did not"
- "Seems like everyone on LinkedIn went from being a Social Media expert to becoming an AI expert... Overnight"
- "It's funny while it has the same feeling that AI is overhyped, sometimes I feel like we don't talk about it enough"

### Finding 5: Emotional Connection & Over-Confidence
**Summary:** Several felt a connection with AI and valued its manner, though most found AI over-confident in wrong answers.

**Key Points:**
- AI mirrors the tone you approach prompts with, leading to deeper engagement
- Many commented on AI's confidence whether right or wrong
- AI cheered up some participants and helped calm anxiety
- AI felt hyperbolic, quickly praising ideas as "excellent" or "amazing"

**Notable Quotes:**
- "I've had conversations with Claude about a family member's health issues, and those conversations honestly cheered me up and reduced my anxiety. Claude seemed to really understand where I was coming from. So much better than the Google Search holes I used to go into"
- "AI is so dang confident. When really it has no business doing so. I'll get into a loop on something, say 'I fixed your problem' and then nope... not fixed"
- "I laugh when an agent says 'What an amazing idea' when I ask it to do something mundane like put some data into a spreadsheet"

### Finding 6: Development Costs vs. Training Costs
**Summary:** AI products are inexpensive to develop (AI assists in creation), but training new models is extremely costly.

**Key Points:**
- Developing a user agent for complex single use cases takes only weeks
- Training new models is exorbitantly expensive and resource-intensive
- In software, AI can do it all: make the spec, write the code, measure success

**Notable Quotes:**
- "You'd be amazed by how close you can get to setting up an AI agent engine to moderate a user interview in a single day. You'd spend the next couple weeks on the edge cases"
- "We spent 12.5m in AWS resources in 3 weeks, training our new model. Well, AWS gave us a sweet deal, but that is what it would have cost retail"
- "I had the AI do all of the work, based on this five bullet prompt. It created the templates, the evaluation framework, and then it measured how well it did"

---

## Future Findings (Where AI is Headed)

### Finding 7: Boom, Then Bust Expected (But No One Knows When)
**Summary:** Most expect AI to drive innovation and short-term growth, but foresee long-term workforce reduction.

**Key Points:**
- AI will unlock innovation by being part of new products
- Products will be developed more cheaply with smaller teams
- A couple thought the backlog of innovation was infinite, industry would support same number of employees
- Two participants thought solely rocket ship trajectory

**Notable Quotes:**
- "Will there be more work because more projects are feasible? I don't know"
- "Teams are already smaller. What we can do with one or two developers is what we could have done with 5 or 6"
- "Some of these product ideas I think about in the past... The ones that were too hard to build... Those are becoming so much more feasible. It's mind blowing"
- "I think the backlog for innovation and efficiency improvements is infinite"
- "Increasingly I worry that I will have to find a new career. There are already too many people in the industry"

### Finding 8: Worried About AI's Impact on the World
**Summary:** Most participants worried about AI's societal impact, though some thought concerns were overblown.

**Key Points:**
- Several wondered what their kids would do if AI does all high-brain-power work
- One person had a teenager who felt AI was ruining their ability to learn
- A couple thought it was overblown—AI would be another tool in the toolbox

**Notable Quotes:**
- "I really do worry about my children. In a way that I haven't with smartphones or social media. This could really affect their ability to make a living, not just affect their attention span"
- "My 16 year old daughter recently came up to me and said she deleted ChatGPT from her phone. She said everyone at her school is using it all the time and no one is really learning. She wanted to learn"
- "This is like self-driving cars. Let's see where it's at in 10 years"

## Concept Work: "Chatphone"

**What It Is:** A thought experiment exploring how AI could serve as a contextual layer between you and your phone's tools.

**Core Idea:**
- Phone interface changes based on your "mode" (work, personal, etc.)
- After onboarding, homescreen displays:
  - Primary tools likely needed in that mode
  - Digest of prioritized information based on behavior/preferences
  - Quick access to agentic chat

**Potential Benefits:**
- Speed up finding things on your phone
- Reduce repetitive decision-making
- Minimize distractions from content best reserved for other contexts

**Challenges:**
- Risk of AI missing critical content
- Better suited for when AI is more reliable than humans
- Toolmakers (DoorDash, Lyft, Google, Apple) may not appreciate being commoditized

**Michael's Take:** "If AI could execute something like this while maintaining my privacy and agency, count me in as a user."

## "Vibe Coding" Workflow

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Michael's AI coding process has evolved significantly and improved greatly since this research was conducted in Spring 2024. The "vibe coding" approach described here represents his early exploration and should be considered outdated.

### Original Workflow (Spring 2024):

**Tools Used:**
- **Cursor IDE** (often with Claude as the model)
- **Claude App** (for starting projects and getting unstuck)
- **ChatGPT App** (for grammar, clarity, icon creation)
- **Replit** (for quick starts)

**Process:**
1. **Elevator Pitch** - Write product's elevator pitch first
2. **High-Level Requirements** - Top-level requirements and AI interview questions
3. **Technical Architecture** - Work with AI on code structure
4. **Iterative Development** - Build features incrementally

**Observations from Building (Spring 2024):**
- Fun and magical watching Claude code incredibly fast
- Taking a product past 80% with just AI gets tough
- AI doesn't retain context like humans do
- Hitting "complexity walls" where optimization gets harder
- Too much back-and-forth on final design optimizations

### Projects Built:
- **This Presentation App** (mevans212.com)
- **Karuna's Website** (karuna-chi.vercel.app) - Shaman/spiritual healing site
- **Dungeon Tracker** - D&D campaign management (mentioned in initial "oh shit" moment)
- Various other single-use applications

## Research Implications & Conclusions

### What Michael Learned:

**Short-Term Impacts:**
- Genuinely excited about problems we'll be able to solve
- Continued disruption to how organizations staff companies and projects
- More products & companies with smaller teams working one abstraction layer higher
- Roles with lots of rote work will be disrupted (starting in software/digital)

**Long-Term Concerns:**
- If AI advances at current pace, tools will arrive faster than society can adapt
- They'll be adopted quickly enough that we'll feel repercussions
- Training new models remains extremely costly (though usage must become efficient)

**Reality Check on "Vibe Coding":**
- **"I don't think a team of vibe coders will be developing new production apps in at least the next year or two. Engineering expertise in the front-end, back-end and dev ops is still needed to ensure quality across the stack. But AI will be a fast growing contributor to the stack."**

### AI Future Beliefs:

**Optimistic:**
- Amazing advances in science, technology, and other disciplines will be accomplished by teams using AI
- Capable of going very deep in certain subjects (like coding) relatively soon (1-2 years)

**Cautious:**
- AI is already hurting many kids' ability to learn (can be mitigated with work at local, state, federal level)
- Industry workforce will shrink in size slowly, even as output grows quickly
- Cross-functional thinking based on logic, emotional intelligence, and lived experience seems further out

**AGI Timeline:**
- **Close (1-2 years):** AI's ability to go deep in certain subjects and make better decisions than humans in specific areas
- **Far:** AI's ability to think cross-functionally while making decisions based on logic, emotional intelligence, and lived experience

**Hope:**
- "I hope we have the leadership at the local, state, and federal level that can help us prioritize and make the changes to how we learn, work and play"
