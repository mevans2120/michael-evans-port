Hi, so, um, this is the chat bot content questionnaire for my website, and, um, I'm just gonna start going through some of the questions. Let's start early, early education. So, um, I grew up in Eugene, Oregon, which is, um, where the University of Oregon is. I grew up not too far from the university. I went to a French immersion elementary school, middle school. Um, and, um, did not do French immersion in high school. But it was a public, all public schools, the public schools in Eugene were great. Um, and, uh, I was raised by hippies. My mom, um, um, my house is purple. My mom is a shaman. There was a yurt in my backyard. Um, I, uh, actually helped one of the first projects I did with A AI building and designing was her website, uh, coronagaten.com. Um, Yeah, the high school I went to was South Eugene High School, the elementary school was Fox Hollow Elementary School, and the middle school was Roosevelt Middle School. Um, I first sort of fell in love with technology when my, my dad, um, the age dates me a bit. My dad gave me his old Mac Plus. Um...


Um, yeah, my 1st uh, computer was a Mac Plus. Um, and then I'll go on to finish the question, question one, which is around what college I went to. Um, but, uh, He gave me a Mac Plus and, um, I, uh, yeah, I instantly fell in love with it. I got a 2400 bod modem and I was able to connect to both BBS's. I remember, you know, going on to America online for the 1st time and really feeling connected to the rest of the world in a way that I had not. I also loved how, uh, how, how sort of fun it was to, to make your own games, that you could actually build things. So I learned basic and Pascal, and I would make hypercard games. Um, and that's really actually, I think that that sort of period in middle school is really what got me sort of interested in technology, because in high school, I focused a lot in English, and I just loved reading. I loved learning. I loved narratives. I loved history. I love political science. I struggled a bit as a freshman in high school. Um, and, uh, Uh, Yeah, as a freshman in high school and, um, realized that, uh, you know, going to college was important and, um, happened to be fortunate enough to have some really, uh, smart friends, who I, I, I learned how to study from them and how to, how to get good grades and like how, Not everything has to be perfect when you're going to school and just trying to get good grades. So sometimes just getting the grade was worth it. You know, sometimes you really do just have to tick a box on everything has to be perfect. Um... I got an international balaureate degree from south and then went to University of Colorado in Boulder and studied English and political science. Um, and didn't really get back into computers until, sort of towards the end of college, I realized that there were probably, you know, writing poetry wasn't gonna necessarily pay the bills. So, I graduate from college. Um, I went back to Eugene, um, and was, uh, you know, trying to figure out what to do with my life. This was right after this was in 2001, right after sort of the first dot com bubble crashed. Um, And while I was there, uh, I've I've had many jobs. I started working when I was 11. My 1st job was, I'm working in a lumberyard, then I worked, I had a paper route. Um, then I worked in a restaurant washing dishes. I did some telemarketing, which was really terrible. I delivered pizzas, and I worked in a drugstore on campus. Those were sort of all of my college jobs, and then after college, took me a little while, but, well, I got a job doing data entry at a software company called Semantec. Um, and we were, like, researching, uh, We were cleaning addresses, and my, I was, I was a, I was there for a few days, and then, um, I got promoted to, we were temps, and now I got promoted sort of a better temp, that was attempt to perm, where I was a dating analyst, essentially, a business analyst, and someone put a book down, it was one of those, uh, um... Idiots guidebooks, Idiots Guide to SQL, to sequel. I'd never heard of sequel, and they're like, Learn this. And so, I, you know, I started to learn sequel, and I learned how to databases work, and I was fortunate enough to have some, uh, a couple really good bosses, and, um, was working on a, um, ERP, CRM, Sibel, which is, you know, ancient, uh, project. and was working with these consultants, and these consultants, uh, well. These consultants made, um, you know, they made quite a bit more money than I did. And, uh, it didn't seem like they were that much smarter than me. They liked me. They started a company, and I went to go work with them doing these, um, salesforce and net suite implementations. I was a solutions architect. Um, and I was actually, like, one of the, it was a remote company. It was, like, back in 2003 or 4. It was one of the first remote companies that I could think of. Uh, And I was good at the work. I didn't really enjoy, you know, building sales systems or accounting systems. I didn't, um, it was, it didn't bring me as much joy, honesty as it would now, I think back then I was probably a little, you know, uh... I, I, I had, I had hopes of, of, well, scratch that. Let's... I didn't find the work as interesting as... As maybe I do now, honestly. But, one of the things I sort of did notice, and I wound up moving from Oregon to New York, where a lot of my family lives, and, uh, was working remotely out of New York, and I was trying to figure out what's, sort of what, uh, what's sort of the best thing for me to do is. And I actually wound up working with his career coach, Maggie Mistall, who's great. One of her first clients. and sort of worked through what I think I should be doing, and I'd always love to use her focused design, You know, I'd loved Apple products. I had, uh, I like things that worked well and were simple. Um, and there were these digital design agencies, RGA and Huge, that were in New York. And, um, this was actually 2008. So I left my job as a consultant at Demand Solutions Group. where we did the net sweetened salesforce implementations. Left my job, and... The 2008 crash happens. Um, And, uh, And I was looking for work and I was like, um, I got an interview at Huge off of a Craigslist dad for a data analyst, or a business, sorry, technical analyst, business analyst. And, um, didn't get the 1st job for it, but interviewed well, and then they called me back and, um, offered me a job when the 2nd position opened, and I jumped at it. I was thrilled. Uh, and once I got there, um, It, I was working on, uh, I worked on a few different projects, but I was working on Broadway.com. And this is my 1st scale. Soup counts. And, um, the designs were beautiful. And I learned a lot, just honestly, because it was kind of a failed project. So this beautiful designs. Um, I was, I was the one who was responsible for writing this, the specification. And the UX work was just... Didn't seem like it hit the mark. Like, it didn't really seem to understand what the product was. And then the technical architecture also had these, like, really, really, uh, really big flaws. There's a Django project, um, you know, Python, and, uh, I remember one of the junior Python developers, whose junior at the time, he, he, he's still, now friend of mine still, but like he, I remember him expressing unease with the technical architecture for Broadway.com. So sure enough, you know, we get it to be, so it looks beautiful, it's ready to go. It ships. It works really well for, like, 3 minutes, and then it just totally crashes and burns. and melts all these servers. And it turns out, the technical architecture, which was inspired by the UX design in a way, was deeply flawed, so flawed that, uh, it showed up as a presentation of what not to do for Django. was this technical architecture, which was sort of connecting everything to everything, which, um, is this, like, an architecture that would work now, sort of modern, uh, the way modern, some non-relational databases can work, but back then, with, uh, you know, I think we were using, uh, I can't remember if it was... What, what, what flavor of database you were using, but it was definitely relational. Um, Yeah, and so then that was like, that was a big teachable moment. It's like, listen to your engineers, make sure that your plans are good, and then got placed on another project for the National Association of Realtors. Um... This project was a blue sky project. So the National Associate Realtors came to huge, and they were, they were said, We want a product that's consumer facing. So NAR, um, you know, they typically, their customers are realtors, but this was for homeowners. And so our team, uh, And at that point, I'd gone from being an analyst to a project manager. Um, and I forgot to say on Broadway.com, I wound up leading that project. Uh, basically because there was, there was no one, no one else was doing it. So I ended, I took it on, and it was something that, it seemed like it suited me. So, I was working on NAR, and, uh, this was sort of kind of, we, we, we applied a lot of the things that, uh, didn't work on Broadway.com to, to NAR. This was also a Django Project, written in with Backend and Python. Front end, and it was, it taught me really about sort of the evolution of products and product market fit, and how, sometimes, the ideas that you can be really tied to, that you think are really good, and you spend a lot of time on, when they're proven not to be the best in the market. Uh, it's good not to be sentimental about them, and good not, you know, the idea of the sun cost fallacy. It's good not to... Uh, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. And let's figure out what does. And I think the idea for house logic.com was like this tool-based site for homeowners, to give them tools, to help them, uh, track projects, and what really made sense for NAR and for their customers was a content site, honestly. And it was providing content for homeowners, both from a, from a perspective of what, what can I do to my house that will improve its home value? So, learning, you know, offering things that I think are fairly well known. It's like kitchen and bathroom renovations are, um, entirely more profitable. Anyway, so there's house logic. Um, and then, uh, After house logic, there are a few projects, like works on something with pent and media. It was a, it was a, it was a druple project. Um, another content site. Um, and then went to go work on with Target. And Target was kind of crazy. Um, they were one of Hugh's biggest clients, and they were, there were like 20 different projects that we were running. I think that Target had generated the most revenue for huge of any client that year that we had, and probably, I think, definitely one of the top grossing clients were huge. and was in Minneapolis, traveling for work a lot, every week, and I think the thing that I really learned with Target, um, was the value of, uh, Both strategy, having a strategy that inspires people, I think part of the reason why, um, huge and Target liked working so well together was, was really this inspirational strategy of... being the place that people love, and sell products that people love versus Walmart, which is more transactional. There is a heart for Target. Um, other things I learned about, did some really forward thinking, like, future of retail work, where we were thinking about how Target can extend the aisles, you know, with your phone, and did some QR code work that I was like, Nay, QR codes will never work, nobody's gonna use it. Uh, and I was wrong about that. I think actually a lot of that QR code work wounding up being super useful. Once, um, Apple decided to integrate QR codes into their phone app, I think that's, that's when, and that plus the pandemic is really when QR codes took off. Uh, I also worked on some TV apps at Huge. I worked on a sort of HBO Go in the Canadian version of HBO Go. I forget, for Astral, um, where we built out a, you know, mobile app. I worked on a payment product paying with your phone. This is, like, another very early tap to pay, which people do all the time with the, you know, the NFC and their phone. But this was, like, how do we teach people how to tap your phone onto, uh, uh, a, a, a, a, a... A credit card processor. Um, and how do we make something that's actually already pretty easy to use, like, a credit card? How do we make it easier than a credit card? It's really the answer is it's just, uh, opening your wallets. Like, opening your phone is easier than opening your wallet. That's how it ends up being easier, and then printing people how to use tap to pay. Again, I was, like, a little bit skeptical about tactipating, wound up really, really working out. Um, after... After that, that, that project, as I wound up working with, the future founders of Work and Co. Felipe Memoria, Gene Liebel, um, and, uh, I'd already worked with Mohan, and I'd worked a little bit with Joe at Target, and, um, with, uh, um, Marcello. So, they liked me. I want this, this is when I moved to San Francisco. And, um, started working with Major League Baseball on a streaming product for Sony, uh, Major League Baseball Advanced Media, they were ultimately sold to, um, ABC, but they did live streaming well before anybody else did live streaming. Back when live streaming was really a challenging, uh, I liken it to just, you're laying down the train tracks as the train's going with live streaming. So, moved to San Francisco, working with MLB Advanced Media. Then I went to work. It was a contract, finished that contract, went to work at Odapod, uh, a design agency, that had done some really good work, and I've, uh, worked with Sony, again there, Sony, for Sony's audio, audio, um, I worked with leapfrog, like, and we made an app for, um, parents. Leafrog makes, like, or used to make. I think it's still around as a brand, but the company's largely sort of disbanded, but pre iPhone, or free every kid having an iPad, were these sort of learning digital learning products that people put a lot of love into. Um, And then, uh, the working co was founded, and I remember Mohan, who's a, you know, friend of mine was texting me and saying, hey, you know, we, um, We're gonna need someone in San Francisco at some point, and I was like, great. Look me up in two years. Couple weeks later, there's a call from Mohan, and he's, like, hanging, there's a pitch that we have. We're not gonna win it. Um, Uh, can I stay at your place? And he's like, you know, if we win this, we're going to need, we're going to need someone like you here in San Francisco. And I was like, oh, and then, you know, and he's like, but don't worry, we're not going to win this pinch. There's no way. And he didn't tell me what it was. Um... I later get a call that, you know, they, it was for Virgin America's website, and, um, that they'd won the pitch, and they needed someone in San Francisco, and they hired me, and I was, like, one of the first employees that worked in Co. And, um, started working on, I think, what's still, like, the most technically challenging project. Um, was Virgin America's booking, booking engine, website, 1st responsive airline website, uh, the website launched and later went, you know, won, I don't know, probably 20 different industry awards and was like very successful. Conversion wise, the project, that project taught me a lot about talent. and how important it is to just have really great people. And we kept bringing people into this project, 'cause airline websites are just very complex, a, Airline ticket is one of the more complex sort of consumer products that people buy every couple, you know, twice 2 or 3 times a year, where it's like, yeah, there's so many decisions that you need to make. Um, when you leave, how long it's gonna take. Is there a connecting flight, you know, when are you flying back? Um, and the price is very dramatically and you need to pick your seat and your seats in the flights. You have to fill out these forms. There's all this compliance, and you can compound all that complexity is like the back end, which is run by Saber, for most all of these airlines, what's run by Saber. There's a few other vendors, but they're... And, um, it was Saber ran on these IBM mainframes. And, uh, they sort of ancient tech, and we were, we were working. It was the 1st big angular project and one of the 1st big single page apps. I really honestly proved that single page apps could scale. And it was like, we were working with cutting edge technology and harnessing it to some of the least cutting edge technology. Um, and we kept bringing in people, uh, developers, designers, and, um, growing the team, uh, because it was very complex project, but we just kept really just hitting the jackpot as far as the talent that we brought in. So that project sips, it's a giant success. Um... I later have, uh... I'm in San Francisco, and we're... got the opportunity to move to Portland, sort of, to be close, and I had a kid at that point, and opened a working code portland office, which, which I did. Well, at, uh, work in go Portland and opening sort of the office, uh, I think one of the big things about opening office, what it, what it taught me was just... how complex. Leadership can seem and be, um... And when at its at its simplest, it is... it's... treating others as you would like to be treated. Caring about your colleagues. And um, and showing it. and being there. Um, and when it's boiled down to its simplest elements, I think it's that's when you can be a great leader. So I opened, yeah, so with Joe Stewart, we opened the work and co-office. And I got to work on isop.com with Isop and sort of wonderful e-commerce project. And I worked on Fox's video applications. Um, I worked with Lyft, um, and I continued to work with Virgin America, and I worked with Alaska Airlines after Alaska bop Virgin America. Through this, I, I had this idea where, um, There, I, you know, I think everyone had smartphones and were, were really becoming distracted by their phones. And I had this idea for just a simpler phone, where you still had all the smarts that you needed, because you really, it is good to have a supercomputer in your pocket, but all of the distracting features, just trying to minimize those as much as possible, but without taking away the power of the phone. I left working coach to start this company. It was before labs, is the name of the company, and we made the before launcher. Um, And this is where I learned that even if you have a successful product, sometimes the business model isn't the business model needs to also, uh, have viability. And consumer apps, especially just Android, which this product had to be, uh, was just a very challenging environment to make money. Um, and at that point, you know, we'd launched the, the app, it won awards, it won a fast company, you know, best app of 2019. People liked it. We, uh, it did work. did what it says on the 10, you know, it, you, you, people open their phones less if they used our launcher. But it wasn't making enough money. Um, and I, uh, this is also around the time of the pandemic. and sold the app, um, and the company to a developer that we were working with. Um, And that's when sort of the pandemic hit and actually I wound up being a primary parent. Um, for a significant chunk of time. I did a little bit of consulting work on the side, but mostly, I was a primary parent, and I think with that just gave me so much empathy for moms, and what moms go through, because it is very challenging to be responsible for young children. especially during a pandemic, especially when they're learning from home. But, uh, there's also, you know, plenty of opportunities for joy. Um, after that, I was consulting and I wound up consulting with huge or with elephant again, and um, went full time with them, and then worked with rum, rum, got hired by raw materials. Um, and I think, seeing with raw materials that I learned was that, it takes more than energy and a good brand to, uh, be successful. That, uh, there needs to be some consistency in your approach, and, um, uh, and real value that you continue to deliver for clients, or else they will stop working with you. Um, the company called Handsome at the time it became raw materials, um, it went from, like, 50 people when I started to 7 people, ultimately when I left. Um, this leaves out... a big... question, sort of, AIML, when did I become interested in it? When I went to college at University of Colorado, Boulder, I spent a year abroad at the University of Sussex in England. And one of my close friends there got his degree in artificial intelligence. And that's, I was kind of blown away. This is 1999. I was kind of blown away that you could major in this stuff. And that's when I learned a little bit about neural networks, and I learned a little bit about, actually, a lot of the stuff that was theorized, it turned out to be true with how AI would work. Um, Other things I've always sort of, with, uh, technology, being someone who's sort of... is often sort of at the forefront, um, of different sort of innovative spaces. I always took it, took it on myself to learn. I really enjoy it. So to learn about new products and new product spaces, and I think the Amazon Alexa is, the ultimate, not AI. You expect it to be AI, I expect to be able to talk to it like it's AI, but it's not. It has very rigid responses. It... almost... And I would so often talk to it like I would want, like, it, like, it should be AI, and just see, is it getting better? And honestly, it never did. And still really hasn't. Um... And then... the fascination with it really, I think, when, uh, when the first chat GPT launched, I, um, was super fascinated with it, but I was also... heads down working with Casa Bonita, um, a restaurant, who didn't really have a lot of AI needs, and we were sort of, we were busy building all the restaurant reservation software, and they had insane amount of interest, so we had to have, like, a queuing system for reservations, and, um, uh, we had, like, you know, 100s of 1000s of people join this club that we created. And that took a long time. And AI progressed fairly well. Someone told me that you could build products with AI, and I tried one, I think I tried an early version of Replet, and was not super impressed, and then, um, really, March of this past year, 2025, is when I had that, oh, oh, Surf. Oh shit moment. I was laid off from, uh... uh... I, from, from raw materials, and I just was with my son, and we, uh, were doing sort of, like, this, uh, trying to build an app to help with Dungeons and Dragons, and build something useful in an hour with Replet. And I was like, Oh, wow. This is, this would have taken, you know, a team, a couple days or a week, at least, to build something like this. And, um, that we could do it in an hour, and that it was useful, blew me away. Um, and I realize I haven't, I haven't, uh, even gone through the questions. I've just been talking. Yeah, so then after that, I did some research, and you can, you can see sort of one of the research projects I did, is, um, at M. Evans 212.com. But that's when I sort of called all my friends and asked them questions. Um, and, uh, um, about AI, about how it impacted their work. Was this going, how was this going to change software development? Um, and did sort of that research paper and continued to sort of build out stuff with AI, and... That's when I realized I kind of had a knack for it, being a business analyst and a project manager, and a CEO of a startup where, you know, I did all of the stuff myself, you know, so much of the design of the app, you know, um, that that sort of soup to nuts, knowledge was able to oversee AI as we work together. on projects. Um, and, uh, the tooling got better, and I sort of got deeper into it. I met these Canadians who, um, uh, are also at the forefront and we sort of have been exchanging tips on how to build with AI. So here I am with you. Um, Things I'm super proud of. Uh, shipping Virgin America and having it work and, um, you know, you can, you know, conversion going up, opening the Portland office, um, sort of starting out the product management team, you know, being one of the founders for the 4 working co. Um, I, uh... I'm proud that I'm kind of like a... a little army of one, you know? I, I, I absolutely don't know everything, but, um, I go pretty deep across, uh, you know, research strategy, design, UX design, technical architecture, and delivery, that I, I can do so many things myself, and, um, yeah, I think I'm proud of that. Um, One of the things I love about working in the space that I do is I get to work with super talented people who will just teach me so much stuff. I learned so much from all of the people in my past, and I'm just very, feel very lucky. Um... Okay, let's go to section two. Technologies, um, I've worked with sort of web and mobile tech, front ends, and back ends. for, like, you know, and seeing it evolve from when we were, you know, cutting out special PNGs for to support IE6. uh, to building dragon drop functionality from scratch, to building charting for United Nations development program from scratch, to just seeing all of these things that spent, that would take weeks, would then take days, uh, going from, uh, having, you know, the infrastructure that would host your software, being just a real, complex, and important decision in order for it to scale and not crash, to being something that's relatively straight straightforward to setup, especially with apps like for sale. Um, And so, as far as technologies, um... What technologies would you work with but wouldn't use again? Drupel? Uh. Really, really did not like the experience of working with that software. I try to be kind of agnostic. It's kind of, once you start work with enough software platforms from CMSs to e-commerce platforms and e-commerce engines, um, You understand that there's a lot of similarity between all of them. They either offer lots of flexibility, and you have to build everything yourself. And or they are constrained, um, and they may, they can maybe get you to a solution really quickly. But you have to do it the way that they want you to do it. Um, And I think one of the sort of things that have been, that's so interesting about II is how that paradigm is, is different. Um, Okay, I'm gonna stop.
