## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What We Have

- **Schema Ready:**

  - Portable Text content support

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` = 5n331bys ‚úÖ
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` = production ‚úÖ
  - `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` = exists in .env.local ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

**Permission Error:** The existing `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` has insufficient "update" permissions.

```
ClientError: transaction failed: Insufficient permissions; permission "update" required
```

## Prerequisites Check

### Required Values
- [x] Sanity Project ID: `5n331bys`
- [x] Sanity Dataset: `production`
- [x] Migration scripts exist and are complete
- [ ] Sanity auth token with write permissions

### Token Permissions Needed
The auth token must have these permissions:
- ‚úÖ Read (has this)
- ‚ùå Create/Update (missing this)
- ‚ùå Delete (may need this)

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Auth Token (Manual)

**Option A: Regenerate Token in Sanity Dashboard**
1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/tokens
2. Delete existing token (if visible)
3. Create new token with permissions:
   - Name: "Migration Token" or "Write Token"
   - Permissions: **Editor** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
4. Copy new token
5. Update `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=<new-token-here>
   ```

**Option B: Create Additional Token (Safer)**
1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/tokens
2. Create new token (keep existing one):
   - Name: "Migration Token"
   - Permissions: **Editor**
3. Copy new token
4. Update `.env.local` temporarily for migration:
   ```bash
   SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=<new-token-here>
   ```
5. After migration, can revert to read-only token if desired

### Phase 2: Run Migration Scripts

**Step 1: Migrate Virgin America**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-virgin-america.ts
```

Expected output:
```

```

**Step 2: Migrate All Other Case Studies**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-all-case-studies.ts
```

Expected output:

## Rollback Plan

If migration causes issues:

```bash
# Migration creates documents with explicit _id values
# To remove all migrated content:
sanity documents delete virgin-america target pedal casa-bonita before-launcher
```

Or manually delete in Sanity Studio.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 5 case studies migrated successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] All case study pages render correctly
- [ ] Homepage shows correct 3 featured case studies
- [ ] Narrative scroll layout displays properly
- [ ] Content is editable in Sanity Studio
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel successfully

## Next Steps After Migration

1. **Add Screenshots:** Upload actual project screenshots to Sanity and add to sections
2. **Add Hero Images:** Upload hero images for each case study
3. **Review Content:** Edit any narrative content for accuracy/clarity
4. **SEO Metadata:** Add meta descriptions and OpenGraph images
5. **Test Production:** Verify everything works on Vercel

## Notes

- Migration scripts use `createOrReplace()` - safe to run multiple times
- Each case study has explicit `_id` for predictable updates
- Scripts preserve existing document structure
- No data loss risk - can always re-run migrations
- Consider backing up Sanity dataset before migration (optional)

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Fix Token):** 5 minutes (manual)
- **Phase 2 (Run Scripts):** 2 minutes (automated)
- **Phase 3 (Verify Studio):** 10 minutes (manual review)
- **Phase 4 (Test Pages):** 15 minutes (manual testing)
- **Phase 5 (Homepage Featured):** 5 minutes (manual update)

**Total:** ~37 minutes
