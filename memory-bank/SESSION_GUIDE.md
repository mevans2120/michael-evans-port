# Session Management Guide

This guide provides checklists and workflows for managing development sessions effectively with the Memory Bank system.

## üìù Session Start Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Check git status
git status
git pull origin main

# Review recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check for dependency updates
npm outdated
```

### 2. Memory Bank Review
```bash
# Review current status
cat memory-bank/CURRENT.md

# Check recent progress
tail -30 memory-bank/PROGRESS.md

# Review any blockers or notes
grep -n "TODO\|FIXME\|NOTE" memory-bank/*.md
```

### 3. AI Assistant Context (If Using)
```markdown
"Please review the memory bank files in the memory-bank/ directory, particularly:
- CURRENT.md for active work
- PROGRESS.md for recent changes
- TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md for architectural context"
```

### 4. Set Session Goals
- [ ] Review carried-over tasks from CURRENT.md
- [ ] Identify 3-5 specific goals for this session
- [ ] Check dependencies and blockers
- [ ] Update CURRENT.md with session start time

## üîÑ During Session Workflow

### Code Changes
1. **Before Making Changes**
   - Review existing code patterns
   - Check ARCHITECTURE.md for standards
   - Consider impact on other components

2. **While Coding**
   - Follow established coding standards
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Update tests for new features
   - Document complex logic inline

3. **Track Progress**
   - Note completed tasks
   - Document any decisions made
   - Record blockers encountered
   - Keep rough notes for session end

### Decision Making
When making technical decisions:
1. Document the context
2. List alternatives considered
3. Explain the chosen approach
4. Note any trade-offs
5. Update TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md if significant

## üìã Session End Checklist

### 1. Code Cleanup
```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests (when available)
npm test

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Format code (if formatter configured)
npm run format
```

### 2. Update Memory Bank

#### Update PROGRESS.md
Add new entry following this template:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Session Title

### Summary
Brief overview of what was accomplished

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Specific task with details
- ‚úÖ Another completed item

### In Progress
- üîÑ Ongoing work (% complete)

### Blocked
- ‚ùå Any blockers and why

### Technical Decisions
- Decision made and rationale

### Next Session
- Priority items for next time

### Notes
- Important observations
- Links to relevant commits/PRs
```

#### Update CURRENT.md
- Move completed items to "Recent Accomplishments"
- Update "In Progress" items with current status
- Add new items to "Next Steps"
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp
- Add any new blockers or considerations

#### Update Other Files (If Applicable)
- **CHANGELOG.md**: For feature completions or releases
- **TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md**: For architectural decisions
- **CONTEXT.md**: For requirement changes

### 3. Git Commit
```bash
# Stage memory bank updates
git add memory-bank/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: Update memory bank - [session summary]"

# Stage and commit code changes separately
git add .
git commit -m "feat/fix/refactor: [specific change description]"

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

### 4. Final Checks
- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] Memory bank updated
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Build still works
- [ ] Tests passing (when available)

## üéØ Best Practices

### DO's
‚úÖ Update memory bank immediately after session
‚úÖ Be specific about what was changed
‚úÖ Include file paths and function names
‚úÖ Document the "why" behind decisions
‚úÖ Link to relevant commits or PRs
‚úÖ Keep entries concise but complete

### DON'Ts
‚ùå Leave memory bank updates for "later"
‚ùå Write vague descriptions like "fixed stuff"
‚ùå Forget to update CURRENT.md status
‚ùå Include sensitive information
‚ùå Skip session due to "small changes"
‚ùå Let memory bank become stale

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "I forgot what I did in the session"
- Check `git diff` for uncommitted changes
- Review `git log` for recent commits
- Look at browser history for researched topics
- Check terminal history for commands run

#### "Memory bank is out of sync"
1. Review recent git commits
2. Update PROGRESS.md with missed sessions
3. Reconcile CURRENT.md with actual state
4. Archive old content if needed

#### "Not sure what to work on"
1. Check CURRENT.md "Next Steps"
2. Review GitHub issues (if using)
3. Look for TODO comments in code
4. Check TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md for pending items

## üìÖ Weekly Maintenance

Every week, consider:
- [ ] Archive old entries from CURRENT.md
- [ ] Review and close completed items
- [ ] Update project priorities
- [ ] Clean up any temporary notes
- [ ] Backup important decisions

## üéâ Session Success Indicators

You know you had a good session when:
- ‚úÖ All planned tasks were addressed
- ‚úÖ Memory bank is fully updated
- ‚úÖ Code is committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ No broken functionality
- ‚úÖ Clear next steps identified
- ‚úÖ You can easily resume next time

*Remember: The memory bank is your friend. Keep it updated, and it will serve you well!*

*Pro Tip: Set a calendar reminder for end-of-session updates.*
