**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Full control over component code
- ✅ Excellent accessibility with Radix UI
- ✅ Consistent with Tailwind CSS approach
- ✅ Components are part of codebase, not external dependency
- ⚠️ Manual updates when new versions released
- ⚠️ More initial setup compared to pre-built libraries

## ADR-004: Client-Side Routing with React Router

**Date**: 2025-09-01 (Retroactive Documentation)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Portfolio site needs navigation between multiple pages while maintaining SPA benefits.
**Decision**: Use React Router DOM v6 for client-side routing.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Declarative routing configuration
- ✅ Support for nested routes
- ✅ Built-in lazy loading support
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ⚠️ SEO requires additional configuration
- ⚠️ No built-in SSR support

---

## ADR-005: TypeScript for Type Safety

**Date**: 2025-09-01 (Retroactive Documentation)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for type safety and better developer experience in a growing codebase.
**Decision**: Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled for all application code.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Compile-time type checking
- ✅ Better IDE support and autocomplete
- ✅ Self-documenting code with interfaces
- ✅ Easier refactoring
- ⚠️ Additional build step
- ⚠️ Learning curve for TypeScript features

---

## ADR-006: Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Date**: 2025-09-01 (Retroactive Documentation)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for rapid UI development with consistent design system.
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS as primary styling solution with custom configuration.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Rapid prototyping with utility classes
- ✅ Consistent spacing and color system
- ✅ Small production CSS bundle with PurgeCSS
- ✅ No CSS naming conflicts
- ⚠️ HTML can become verbose with many classes
- ⚠️ Learning curve for utility-first approach

---

## ADR-007: TanStack Query for Server State

**Date**: 2025-09-01 (Retroactive Documentation)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for robust data fetching and caching solution for future API integrations.
**Decision**: Use TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Built-in caching and synchronization
- ✅ Optimistic updates support
- ✅ Background refetching
- ✅ Request deduplication
- ⚠️ Additional abstraction layer
- ⚠️ Overkill for simple static data

---

## ADR-008: Monolithic Repository Structure

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Portfolio site is a single application without need for multiple packages.
**Decision**: Maintain monolithic repository structure rather than monorepo with workspaces.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simpler development setup
- ✅ Easier deployment process
- ✅ No workspace configuration needed
- ⚠️ Harder to extract reusable packages later
- ⚠️ All dependencies in single package.json

---

## ADR-009: Static Deployment Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Proposed
**Context**: Portfolio site is primarily static content without server-side requirements.
**Decision**: Deploy as static site to CDN (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages).
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Zero server costs
- ✅ Excellent performance with CDN
- ✅ Simple deployment process
- ✅ High availability
- ⚠️ No server-side rendering for SEO
- ⚠️ Client-side only for dynamic features

---

## ADR-010: Component-Driven Development

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for reusable, maintainable UI components.
**Decision**: Follow atomic design principles with clear component hierarchy.
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Reusable component library
- ✅ Consistent UI patterns
- ✅ Easier testing of components
- ✅ Better organization
- ⚠️ More upfront planning needed
- ⚠️ Can lead to over-abstraction

## ADR-011: Sanity CMS for Content Management

**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Proposed
**Context**: Portfolio site currently uses static content hardcoded in React components. Need for dynamic content management to easily update projects, case studies, and potentially add blog functionality without code deployments.
**Decision**: Implement Sanity CMS as the headless CMS solution for content management.
**Rationale**:
- **Free tier sufficient**: 1M API requests/month and 100GB bandwidth covers portfolio needs
- **React-based Studio**: Sanity Studio built with React aligns with existing tech stack
- **Real-time collaboration**: Live multi-user editing capabilities
- **Flexible schemas**: Schema-as-code approach provides full control
- **Image optimization**: Built-in image pipeline with on-demand transformations
- **GROQ queries**: Powerful query language for complex data fetching
- **Developer experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and documentation
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Content updates without code deployment
- ✅ Rich text editing with portable text
- ✅ Centralized media management
- ✅ Better SEO with dynamic meta tags
- ✅ Foundation for future blog functionality
- ⚠️ Additional complexity in architecture
- ⚠️ Learning curve for GROQ and portable text
- ⚠️ Dependency on external service
- ⚠️ Need to migrate existing static content

## Future Considerations

### Pending Decisions
1. **Analytics Platform**: Google Analytics vs Privacy-focused alternatives
2. **Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library vs Vitest
3. **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions vs Vercel/Netlify built-in
4. **Error Tracking**: Sentry vs LogRocket vs Custom solution
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI vs Custom metrics

### Technical Debt
1. No test coverage currently
2. Missing SEO optimization
3. No error boundary implementation
4. No accessibility audit performed
5. No performance benchmarks established
