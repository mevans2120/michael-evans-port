# Current Development Status

## 📍 Active Sprint: Content Specifications & Vector Database Optimization
*Last Updated: 2025-10-27*

## 🎯 Current Focus
Created comprehensive content specifications for all case studies and profile/about page based on vector database source material.

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments (This Session)

### Vector Database Optimization
- ✅ Increased chunk overlap from 50 to 150 characters in embeddings.ts

  - Before Launcher: 17→24 chunks (+41%)
  - Target: 19→23 chunks (+21%)
  - Casa Bonita: 7→10 chunks (+43%)
- ✅ Created analysis scripts:
  - `analyze-chunks.ts` - Overall chunk association analysis
  - `analyze-project-chunks.ts` - Deep dive into project-specific chunks

- ✅ Build successfully completes with no errors

## 📊 Content Spec Details

Each specification includes:
- **Structured Metadata** - Ready for Sanity CMS import
- **Hero Sections** - Title, tagline, 2-3 sentence summary
- **Key Metrics** - JSON format (4 metrics per project)
- **Achievements Array** - JSON format (6-8 per project)
- **8-10 Content Sections** - Full prose narratives with lessons learned
- **Technologies Used** - JSON arrays
- **SEO Metadata** - Titles, descriptions, keywords
- **Images Needed** - Specific lists (6-7 per project)
- **Related Projects** - Cross-linking
- **Source References** - Traceability to transcript files

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (User Decision)
1. **Review content specifications** - Read through specs, suggest changes
2. **Source images** - Gather hero images, screenshots, awards for each project
3. **Implement in Sanity** - Create project documents from specs
4. **Build page templates** - Create case study detail page components
5. **Launch enhanced portfolio** - Deploy with rich content

### Priority Implementation Order
**P0 (Immediate):**
- Virgin America (flagship, most awards)
- Before Launcher (unique product story)
- Profile/About (essential for understanding who you are)

**P1 (High):**
- Casa Bonita (recent, technical excellence)
- Target (enterprise credibility)

**P2 (Standard):**
- Pedal (strong metrics, good tech story)

## 📝 Quick Notes
- **Portfolio Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Tailwind CSS 3.4, Sanity CMS
- **Chatbot Stack**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Supabase pgvector, Vercel AI SDK
- **Vector DB**: 365 chunks with improved project name association
- **Content Voice**: Written in your voice from transcript material
- **Data-Driven**: Every spec includes specific metrics and outcomes
- **Story-Focused**: Problem → Solution → Results → Learnings structure
