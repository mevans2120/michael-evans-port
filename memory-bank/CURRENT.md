# Current Development Status

## 📍 Active Sprint: Architecture & Documentation Setup
*Last Updated: 2025-09-15 16:00*

## 🎯 Current Focus
Setting up comprehensive architecture documentation and memory bank system for the portfolio site.

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments (Last Session)
- ✅ Analyzed existing portfolio site structure
- ✅ Reviewed codymd-hacknback memory bank implementation for patterns
- ✅ Created comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md with:
  - Technology stack documentation
  - File structure mapping
  - Proposed architectural enhancements
  - Detailed coding standards
  - Security and performance guidelines
- ✅ Designed memory bank system structure
- ✅ Created memory bank README with complete workflow guide

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Complete memory bank initialization
- [ ] Set up remaining memory bank files
- [ ] Create npm scripts for memory bank workflow
- [ ] Document existing components and patterns

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Initialize all memory bank files with appropriate templates
2. Create SESSION_GUIDE.md with workflow checklists
3. Document technical decisions made so far
4. Set up project context documentation
5. Create first CHANGELOG entry
6. Add memory bank scripts to package.json
7. Consider git hooks for memory bank reminders

## 📝 Quick Notes
- Portfolio site uses React 18.3 with Vite and TypeScript
- Routing handled by React Router DOM
- UI components from shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Current pages: Home, About, Capabilities, AI Showcase, AI Research, Case Studies
- No backend currently - static site deployment

## 🔗 Key Files
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete technical architecture plan
- `/memory-bank/README.md` - Memory bank system documentation
- `/src/App.tsx` - Main application router
- `/src/pages/` - All page components
- `/src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components

## 🐛 Known Issues
- None currently identified

## 💭 Considerations
- Need to determine deployment strategy (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages?)
- Consider adding analytics integration
- Plan for SEO optimization
- Evaluate need for CMS integration for case studies
- Consider implementing dark mode support

## 📊 Project Health
- **Code Quality**: Good - consistent patterns, TypeScript usage
- **Documentation**: In Progress - creating comprehensive docs
- **Testing**: Not Set Up - needs implementation
- **Performance**: Unknown - needs measurement
- **Security**: Basic - no sensitive data handling currently
