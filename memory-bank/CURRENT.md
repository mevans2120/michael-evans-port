### About Page Implementation (October 28, 2025)

**Phase 1: CMS Schema Expansion** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Expanded profile schema in `/sanity/schemas/profile.ts` with comprehensive about page fields:
  - Hero section (heroHeadline, heroSubheadline, heroIntro)
  - Quick facts array (6 label/value pairs)
  - Capabilities array (7 items with title, description, isNew badge)
  - Dynamic sections array (content with subsections, visibility toggle, slugs for anchors)
  - Selected projects array (4 projects with metrics, descriptions, order)
  - Technologies object (8 categories: frontend, mobile, backend, CMS, data, AI/ML, deployment, enterprise)
  - Availability & CTA fields (availability boolean, availabilityText, ctaText, ctaButtonText)
- ‚úÖ Added preview configurations for all new field types
- ‚úÖ Preserved legacy fields for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Schema tested successfully in Sanity Studio

**Phase 2: Page Component** ‚úÖ

  - Dynamic content sections with PortableText support
  - Capabilities list with purple dash bullets and hover effects
  - Selected projects with metrics and descriptions

  - 4 selected projects (Before Launcher, Casa Bonita, Virgin America, AI Research)
  - 3 content sections with subsections ("At a Glance", "From Yurts to Gigahertz", "Three Things About Me")
  - CTA data

**Design Refinements** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Created design concepts in `/docs/design/concepts-batch-1-102825/`:
  - `mood-board.html` - Visual reference for all three directions
  - `concept-1-minimal.html` - Minimal elegance with Crimson Pro
  - `concept-2-bold.html` - Bold brutalist with terminal aesthetic

## üêõ Known Issues
- None - build successful, all TypeScript errors resolved, about page fully functional

## üí≠ Considerations
- About page is live and editable through Sanity Studio at http://localhost:3000/studio
- Migration script can be re-run to reset content or used as template for other migrations
- Content spec serves as blueprint for expanding about page with additional sections
- Design concepts provide reference for future page designs
- Homepage tagline preserved: "Building products at the intersection of user empathy, technical possibility, and business value"

## üìä Project Health
- **Code Quality**: Excellent - TypeScript throughout, production build successful
- **Documentation**: Excellent - comprehensive content specs + implementation plan + migration docs
- **CMS**: Fully integrated - About page schema complete with content populated
- **Design**: Refined - Dark theme, proper typography, responsive, animated
- **Next Phase**: Case study page implementation, additional content sections
