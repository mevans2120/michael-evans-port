# Current Development Status

## üìç Active Sprint: AI Assistant Chat UX Improvements
*Last Updated: 2025-11-01*

## üéØ Current Focus
Fixed AI Assistant chat chevron button functionality and improved header layout to show "MEvans AI Assistant" when expanded.

## ‚úÖ Recent Accomplishments (November 1, 2025)

### AI Assistant Chat Chevron Button Fix

**Problem Identified**:
- Chevron button in chat header wasn't receiving click events
- Button appeared to work to expand chat, but failed to close it
- Console logs showed no "BUTTON CLICKED" events firing when clicked
- Yellow "Detected" warning appeared on click, indicating React state change but UI not responding

**Root Cause Analysis** ‚úÖ:
- NavigationMenu component had duplicate "AI Assistant" text that appeared when chat was expanded
- This duplicate text element was overlapping the ChatSection header area
- NavigationMenu logo had `z-20` and was physically covering the chevron button
- Even though chevron had `z-50`, parent container hierarchy caused click interception

**Solution Implemented** ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate "AI Assistant" text from NavigationMenu component
- ‚úÖ Added `pointer-events-none` to NavigationMenu logo when `chatExpanded` is true
- ‚úÖ Modified ChatSection to hide sparkle emoji when expanded (`{!chatExpanded && <Sparkles />}`)
- ‚úÖ Added conditional left margin to "AI Assistant" text (`ml-16` when expanded)
- ‚úÖ Updated MEvans logo colors when chat expanded (black "M", purple "Evans")
- ‚úÖ Chevron button now works to both open and close chat

**Layout Improvements** ‚úÖ:
- **When chat is closed**: Shows ‚ú® "AI Assistant"
- **When chat is open**: Shows "M**Evans** _____ AI Assistant" (black M, purple Evans, proper spacing)
- Sparkle emoji only appears in collapsed state
- Clean visual hierarchy when expanded

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/navigation/ChatSection.tsx` - Hide sparkle when expanded, add spacing
- `src/components/navigation/NavigationMenu.tsx` - Add pointer-events-none, update colors
- `src/app/globals.css` - CSS variable changes (already in place from previous work)

**Testing** ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ Production build successful (zero errors, zero warnings)
- ‚úÖ Chevron clicks register in console ("üî• BUTTON CLICKED!")
- ‚úÖ Chat opens and closes smoothly
- ‚úÖ Text layout properly shows "MEvans AI Assistant" when expanded
- ‚úÖ No visual overlap or click interference

## ‚úÖ Previous Session (October 30, 2025)

### Content System Audit & Reorganization

**Problem Identified**:
- Content was duplicated between `docs/research/` and `public/chatbot-content/transcripts/`
- Confusion about source of truth location
- Searches for Aesop/Lyft content failed because files existed in `public/` but not in `docs/`

**Resolution** ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicates from `docs/research/`
- ‚úÖ Established `public/chatbot-content/transcripts/` as single source of truth
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive audit document: `/docs/content-system-audit-and-reorganization-2025-10-30.md`
- ‚úÖ Documented that transcript files contain comprehensive narrative content (career history, case studies, technical details mixed together)
- ‚úÖ Kept flat file structure (no topic-based splitting needed - content is naturally mixed in narratives)

## ‚úÖ Previous Session (October 29, 2025)

  - Case studies with measurable results (Lyft 8%, Aesop 12%)
  - Agentic engineering best practices
  - Leadership experience and insights

## üìä Content System Architecture

### Single Source of Truth
**Location**: `public/chatbot-content/transcripts/` ‚úÖ

**Contents** (9 files):
1. `aesop_and_lyft_case_studies.md` - Case study details with metrics and results
2. `agentic_engineering.md` - AI development philosophy and best practices
3. `ai-research-summary.md` - Research findings from interviews
4. `before-launcher-details.md` - Before Launcher case study details
5. `chatbot-questionnaire_Answers_1.md` - Comprehensive narrative transcript (career history, case studies, personal background)
6. `chatbot-questionnaire_Answers_2.md` - Additional narrative content
7. `faq-chunks.md` - Frequently asked questions
8. `opening_portland_office.md` - Leadership experience and insights
9. `technical-architecture-ai-projects.md` - Technical details for 12 AI projects

**Raw Files**: `_Raw_Files_Ignore/` subdirectory (not ingested)

### Content Workflow
1. **Source**: All transcript content lives in `public/chatbot-content/transcripts/`
2. **Ingestion**: Run `npm run ingest` to sync to vector database
3. **Chatbot**: Searches unified vector DB containing transcript + Sanity CMS content
4. **Updates**:
   - Sanity content auto-syncs via webhooks (< 30s)
   - Transcript content requires manual `npm run ingest` after edits

### Why Flat Structure Works
- Transcript files contain **comprehensive narratives** with mixed content
- Career history, case studies, and technical details naturally intertwined
- Splitting into topic folders would break context and narrative flow
- Flat structure preserves the conversational, interconnected nature of interviews

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Case Study Implementation
1. Run export script to generate NDJSON for Lyft and Aesop case studies
2. Import to Sanity via CLI: `sanity dataset import case-studies.ndjson production`
3. Add real images to replace placeholders in Sanity Studio
4. Verify case study pages render correctly on frontend
5. Test featured case study cards on homepage

### Content Expansion
1. Create content specs for remaining projects (if any)
2. Add more technical details to existing case studies
3. Expand AI projects documentation
4. Consider adding testimonials or recommendations

### Design & UX
1. Review case study layout in narrative scroll format
2. Adjust spacing, typography, animations as needed
3. Add image galleries or interactive elements
4. Optimize for mobile experience

## üìù Quick Notes
- **Portfolio Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Tailwind CSS 3.4, Sanity CMS
- **Chatbot Stack**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Supabase pgvector, Vercel AI SDK, smart sync system
- **Vector DB**: Dual content sources (Sanity CMS + transcripts), 170 chunks from transcripts
- **Content Source of Truth**: `public/chatbot-content/transcripts/` (9 files, flat structure)
- **Build Status**: Production build successful, zero errors, zero warnings
- **Case Studies**: 7 comprehensive specs ready (Virgin America, Before Launcher, Casa Bonita, Target, Peddle, Lyft, Aesop)

## üîó Key Files

### Created This Session (October 30)

**Content System**:
- `/docs/content-system-audit-and-reorganization-2025-10-30.md` - Comprehensive audit and recommendations
- `/docs/content-specs/lyft-case-study.md` - Full Lyft case study specification
- `/docs/content-specs/aesop-case-study.md` - Full Aesop case study specification

### Source of Truth Location
- `/public/chatbot-content/transcripts/` - All transcript content (9 markdown files)
- `/public/chatbot-content/transcripts/_Raw_Files_Ignore/` - Raw transcript .txt files

### Existing Case Study Specs
- `/docs/content-specs/virgin-america-case-study.md`
- `/docs/content-specs/before-launcher-case-study.md`
- `/docs/content-specs/casa-bonita-case-study.md`
- `/docs/content-specs/target-case-study.md`
- `/docs/content-specs/peddle-case-study.md`

### Migration & Scripts
- `/src/scripts/export-case-studies-ndjson.ts` - Export case studies to NDJSON for Sanity import
- `/src/scripts/list-sanity-projects.ts` - List current projects in Sanity
- `/src/scripts/migrate-case-studies.ts` - Original API-based migration (deprecated due to permissions)

## üêõ Known Issues
- None - build successful, all content properly organized, vector DB synced

## üí≠ Considerations
- Transcript files are comprehensive narratives, not single-topic documents
- Content naturally mixes career history, case studies, technical details, and personal background
- Flat structure in `public/chatbot-content/transcripts/` works best for this type of content
- Case study specs can now be migrated to Sanity using NDJSON export approach
- Real images will need to be added to Sanity Studio after migration

## üìä Project Health
- **Code Quality**: Excellent - TypeScript throughout, production build clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Documentation**: Excellent - comprehensive case study specs, content system audit
- **Content System**: Organized - single source of truth established, no duplication
- **Vector DB**: Synced - 170 chunks from 9 transcript files, includes Aesop/Lyft details
- **Next Phase**: Case study migration to Sanity, image uploads, frontend verification
