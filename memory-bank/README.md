# Memory Bank System - Portfolio Site

## üìö Overview

The Memory Bank is a comprehensive documentation system designed to maintain project continuity, track development progress, and preserve technical decisions across development sessions. This system is inspired by the successful implementation in the codymd-hacknback project but tailored for the portfolio site's specific needs.

## üéØ Purpose

1. **Development Continuity**: Seamlessly continue work across sessions
2. **Knowledge Preservation**: Document decisions, patterns, and solutions
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor feature development and milestones
4. **AI Assistance**: Provide context for AI-powered development tools
5. **Team Collaboration**: Onboard new developers quickly

## üîÑ Workflow

### Starting a Session

1. **Review Current State**
   ```bash
   cat memory-bank/CURRENT.md
   tail -20 memory-bank/PROGRESS.md
   ```

2. **Check Recent Changes**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   git status
   ```

3. **Update CURRENT.md**
   - Mark previous session's tasks as complete/carried over
   - Add today's focus and goals

### During the Session

1. **Track Changes**
   - Keep notes of significant changes
   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Note any blockers or issues

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update relevant memory bank files as you work
   - Keep CURRENT.md in sync with actual progress

### Ending a Session

1. **Update PROGRESS.md**
   ```markdown
   ## [2025-09-15 16:00] - Architecture Planning
   ### Summary
   Developed comprehensive architecture plan and memory bank system

   ### Completed
   - Created ARCHITECTURE.md with coding standards
   - Designed memory bank system structure
   - Established development workflow

   ### Notes
   - Following patterns from codymd-hacknback project
   - Adapted for portfolio site requirements
   ```

2. **Update CURRENT.md**
   - Update task statuses
   - Add next session's priorities
   - Note any blockers

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add memory-bank/
   git commit -m "docs: Update memory bank - [session summary]"
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Development

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "memory:start": "cat memory-bank/CURRENT.md && tail -20 memory-bank/PROGRESS.md",
    "memory:update": "echo 'Remember to update memory bank files!'",
    "memory:status": "ls -la memory-bank/*.md",
    "memory:archive": "node scripts/archive-memory-bank.js"
  }
}
```

### Git Hooks
Consider adding a pre-commit hook to remind about memory bank updates:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "üìù Remember to update memory bank files if needed!"
echo "   - CURRENT.md for active work"
echo "   - PROGRESS.md for session summary"
```

### AI Assistant Integration
When working with AI assistants (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.):
1. Start by having them review memory bank files
2. Reference memory bank for context
3. Update memory bank with AI-assisted changes

## üìä Best Practices

### Writing Effective Entries

1. **Be Specific**
   - Include file names and line numbers
   - Mention specific functions or components
   - Document exact error messages

2. **Be Concise**
   - Use bullet points for lists
   - Write clear, scannable summaries
   - Avoid redundant information

3. **Be Contextual**
   - Explain why, not just what
   - Include reasoning for decisions
   - Note alternatives considered

4. **Be Timely**
   - Update during or immediately after work
   - Don't rely on memory days later
   - Capture thoughts while fresh

### Maintenance Schedule

- **Daily**: Update CURRENT.md and PROGRESS.md
- **Weekly**: Review and clean CURRENT.md
- **Monthly**: Archive old progress entries
- **Quarterly**: Move old content to archive folder

### Templates

#### Session Start Template (CURRENT.md)
```markdown
## Session: [Date] - [Focus Area]

### Today's Goals
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3

### Carrying Over
- [ ] Previous incomplete task

### Notes
- Any important context for today
```

#### Session End Template (PROGRESS.md)
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Session Title

### Summary
One-line summary of what was accomplished

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Task with outcome
- ‚úÖ Another task with technical details

### In Progress
- üîÑ Ongoing task (% complete)

### Blocked
- ‚ùå Blocked item and reason

### Decisions
- Chose X over Y because Z

### Next Session
- Priority items for next time
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Initialize Memory Bank**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p memory-bank/archive
   touch memory-bank/{CURRENT,PROGRESS,CHANGELOG,TECHNICAL_DECISIONS,CONTEXT,SESSION_GUIDE}.md
   ```

2. **Create Initial Content**
   - Copy this README.md
   - Create initial CURRENT.md with project status
   - Add first entry to PROGRESS.md

3. **Establish Workflow**
   - Add npm scripts to package.json
   - Set up git hooks if desired
   - Create calendar reminder for updates

## üìà Success Metrics

- **Continuity**: Can resume work without context loss
- **Clarity**: New developers understand project quickly
- **Completeness**: All significant work is documented
- **Consistency**: Regular updates maintain accuracy

## üîó Related Documentation

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - Technical architecture
- [README.md](../README.md) - Project setup and overview
- [package.json](../package.json) - Scripts and dependencies

## üí° Tips

1. **Use Markdown Links**: Link to specific files and commits
2. **Include Code Snippets**: Show actual code changes
3. **Add Screenshots**: For UI changes (store in archive/)
4. **Tag Versions**: Use git tags for major milestones
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link between memory bank files

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Not a Replacement**: Memory bank supplements, not replaces, code comments and documentation
2. **Keep It Updated**: Stale documentation is worse than none
3. **Version Control**: Always commit memory bank updates
4. **Privacy**: Don't include sensitive information
5. **Backup**: Memory bank is part of your repository backup
