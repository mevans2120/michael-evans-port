# Development Progress Log

## [2025-09-15 16:00] - Architecture Planning & Memory Bank Setup

### Summary
Initial architecture analysis and comprehensive documentation setup for Michael Evans portfolio site. Established coding standards and designed memory bank system based on successful patterns from codymd-hacknback project.

### Completed
- ✅ Analyzed current portfolio site structure and technology stack
- ✅ Reviewed and learned from codymd-hacknback memory bank implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md documenting:
  - Current technology stack (React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
  - File structure and organization
  - Proposed architectural enhancements
  - Detailed coding standards for TypeScript, React, CSS
  - Git commit conventions
  - Testing, security, and performance standards
- ✅ Designed and documented memory bank system:
  - Created detailed README.md explaining the system
  - Defined file structure and purposes
  - Established workflow for session management
  - Created templates for consistent documentation

### Technical Decisions
- Adopted memory bank pattern from codymd-hacknback with adaptations for portfolio site
- Chose to maintain similar file structure (CURRENT, PROGRESS, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- Decided on quarterly archival strategy for historical records
- Selected Markdown format for all documentation for version control compatibility

### Discoveries
- Site uses shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- TanStack Query already integrated for data fetching
- Multiple case study pages already implemented
- No backend currently - pure frontend deployment

### In Progress
- 🔄 Setting up remaining memory bank files (70% complete)
- 🔄 Creating npm scripts for workflow automation

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete memory bank file initialization
2. Create SESSION_GUIDE.md with detailed checklists
3. Add memory bank npm scripts to package.json
4. Document existing UI components
5. Set up git hooks for memory bank reminders
6. Create initial CHANGELOG and TECHNICAL_DECISIONS entries

### Notes
- Portfolio structure is clean and well-organized
- Good use of TypeScript throughout
- Consistent component patterns already in place
- Ready for enhancement with memory bank system

## [2025-10-26 18:55] - AI Chatbot RAG Implementation

### Summary
Built and integrated complete $0/month RAG-powered AI chatbot for portfolio. Implemented full vector search pipeline with Google Gemini, Supabase pgvector, and Vercel AI SDK. Created ~24,000 words of training content from voice transcripts.

### Completed
- ✅ **Infrastructure Setup**:
  - Installed dependencies: `ai`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `tsx`, `dotenv`, `pg`
  - Created Supabase project and configured environment variables
  - Set up database schema with pgvector extension
- ✅ **Core Modules** (8 files created):
  - `/src/lib/chatbot/supabase.ts` - Database client with lazy initialization, vector search function (`searchSimilarDocuments`), document management, chat session management
  - `/src/lib/chatbot/embeddings.ts` - Text chunking (500 chars, 50 overlap), embedding generation with Google text-embedding-004, batch processing
  - `/src/lib/chatbot/database-schema.sql` - Complete PostgreSQL schema: documents table with VECTOR(768), chat_sessions table, match_documents() function, RLS policies, indexes
  - `/src/lib/chatbot/ingest-content.ts` - Content ingestion script with progress logging, source detection, batch embedding generation
  - `/src/lib/chatbot/setup-database.ts` - Database setup helper with DATABASE_URL support
- ✅ **UI Components** (4 files created):
  - `/src/components/chatbot/Chatbot.tsx` - Main component with open/close state
  - `/src/components/chatbot/ChatInterface.tsx` - Full modal UI with useChat hook, suggested questions, mobile responsive
  - `/src/components/chatbot/ChatMessage.tsx` - Message bubbles with role-based styling, Framer Motion animations
  - `/src/components/chatbot/ChatButton.tsx` - Floating button with hover effects
- ✅ **API Route**:
  - `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Edge runtime RAG pipeline: embedding generation → vector search (top 5, >0.7 similarity) → context assembly → streaming response with Gemini 1.5 Pro
- ✅ **Content Preparation**:
  - Processed 3 transcript files (~24,000 words total):
    - Professional background & career history (~8,000 words)
    - Projects & current work (~12,000 words)
    - AI research findings (~4,000 words)
- ✅ **Documentation**:
  - `/CHATBOT-QUICKSTART.md` - 3-step setup guide
  - `/docs/research/research-batch-1-102525/CHATBOT-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Full documentation with architecture, troubleshooting, deployment
- ✅ **Integration**:
  - Added `<Chatbot />` to `/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Created npm scripts: `setup-db`, `ingest`, `ingest:clear`
  - Updated package.json with new scripts

### Technical Implementation Details

**RAG Pipeline:**
```
User Question
  ↓ Generate embedding (Google text-embedding-004, 768 dimensions)
  ↓ Vector search (Supabase pgvector, cosine similarity, top 5 results, threshold 0.7)
  ↓ Build context (relevant chunks with source metadata)
  ↓ LLM generation (Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, temperature 0.7)
  ↓ Stream response (Vercel AI SDK)
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Embeddings**: Google text-embedding-004 (768-dimensional)
- **Vector DB**: Supabase pgvector with ivfflat index
- **LLM**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (gemini-1.5-pro-002)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 App Router, Edge runtime
- **UI**: Framer Motion animations, Radix UI primitives
- **State**: Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook

**Cost Analysis**: $0/month
- Google Gemini free tier: 15 RPM, 1,500 requests/day
- Supabase free tier: 500MB storage (using ~3MB), 2GB bandwidth
- Vercel free tier: Hobby plan

### Technical Decisions
- **Chose Google Gemini over Claude**: Free tier available, good performance for portfolio use case
- **Chose text-embedding-004**: Latest Google model, 768 dimensions, free tier
- **Chunk size 500 chars, 50 overlap**: Balances context preservation with retrieval precision
- **Top 5 results, 0.7 threshold**: Provides sufficient context without noise
- **Edge runtime**: Better performance, lower costs, streaming support
- **Lazy Supabase client initialization**: Ensures environment variables loaded before client creation
- **Manual database setup**: REST API approach not available, PostgreSQL direct connection requires DATABASE_URL

### Discoveries
- Supabase REST API doesn't expose SQL execution endpoint for schema setup
- Environment variables need to be loaded before Supabase client initialization
- Next.js 15 with React 19 requires `--legacy-peer-deps` for some packages (react-day-picker conflict)
- Google Gemini streaming works seamlessly with Vercel AI SDK
- Vercel AI SDK version compatibility: using 3.4.33 for stability

### In Progress
- 🔄 Database schema setup (manual step - user needs to execute SQL in Supabase dashboard)
- 🔄 Content ingestion (waiting for database schema)
- 🔄 Testing with sample questions

### Next Session Priorities
1. Verify user has set up database schema
2. Run content ingestion: `npm run ingest`
3. Test chatbot with multiple questions
4. Fine-tune system prompt based on responses
5. Add to production (Vercel environment variables + deploy)
6. Consider UX improvements: suggested questions, typing indicator, feedback mechanism

### Notes
- Content is production-ready with ~24,000 words covering background, projects, and research
- System prompt defines Michael's voice: professional but approachable, knowledgeable without arrogance
- Chatbot appears as floating button in bottom-right (all pages)
- Mobile responsive design with full-screen modal on small screens
- All environment variables properly configured in `.env.local`

  - Corrected Before Launcher description (removed AI mentions)
  - Fixed company name: "Before Labs" not "Beforelab"
  - Corrected Astral description (Canadian cable company)
  - Updated ingest script to use correct directory
  - Added logic to skip raw transcript files
- ✅ **Test & Evaluation**:

- Evaluate partial answers rather than exact matches
- Document all technical projects comprehensively

### Discoveries
- Test criteria were too strict causing false negatives
- Raw transcripts were being unnecessarily indexed
