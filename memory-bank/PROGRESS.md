# Development Progress Log

## [2025-09-15 16:00] - Architecture Planning & Memory Bank Setup

### Summary
Initial architecture analysis and comprehensive documentation setup for Michael Evans portfolio site. Established coding standards and designed memory bank system based on successful patterns from codymd-hacknback project.

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Analyzed current portfolio site structure and technology stack
- ‚úÖ Reviewed and learned from codymd-hacknback memory bank implementation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md documenting:
  - Current technology stack (React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
  - File structure and organization
  - Proposed architectural enhancements
  - Detailed coding standards for TypeScript, React, CSS
  - Git commit conventions
  - Testing, security, and performance standards
- ‚úÖ Designed and documented memory bank system:
  - Created detailed README.md explaining the system
  - Defined file structure and purposes
  - Established workflow for session management
  - Created templates for consistent documentation

### Technical Decisions
- Adopted memory bank pattern from codymd-hacknback with adaptations for portfolio site
- Chose to maintain similar file structure (CURRENT, PROGRESS, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- Decided on quarterly archival strategy for historical records
- Selected Markdown format for all documentation for version control compatibility

### Discoveries
- Site uses shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- TanStack Query already integrated for data fetching
- Multiple case study pages already implemented
- No backend currently - pure frontend deployment

### In Progress
- üîÑ Setting up remaining memory bank files (70% complete)
- üîÑ Creating npm scripts for workflow automation

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete memory bank file initialization
2. Create SESSION_GUIDE.md with detailed checklists
3. Add memory bank npm scripts to package.json
4. Document existing UI components
5. Set up git hooks for memory bank reminders
6. Create initial CHANGELOG and TECHNICAL_DECISIONS entries

### Notes
- Portfolio structure is clean and well-organized
- Good use of TypeScript throughout
- Consistent component patterns already in place
- Ready for enhancement with memory bank system
